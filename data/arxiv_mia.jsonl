{"text": "Title: Pareto-Optimal Allocation of Indivisible Goods with Connectivity Constraints\nAbstract: We study the problem of allocating indivisible items to agents with additive valuations, under the additional constraint that bundles must be connected in an underlying item graph. Previous work has considered the existence and complexity of fair allocations. We study the problem of finding an allocation that is Pareto-optimal. While it is easy to find an efficient allocation when the underlying graph is a path or a star, the problem is NP-hard for many other graph topologies, even for trees of bounded pathwidth or of maximum degree 3. We show that on a path, there are instances where no Pareto-optimal allocation satisfies envy-freeness up to one good, and that it is NP-hard to decide whether such an allocation exists, even for binary valuations. We also show that, for a path, it is NP-hard to find a Pareto-optimal allocation that satisfies maximin share, but show that a moving-knife algorithm can find such an allocation when agents have binary valuations that have a non-nested interval structure.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Two remarks on graph norms\nAbstract: For a graph $H$, its homomorphism density in graphs naturally extends to the space of two-variable symmetric functions $W$ in $L^p$, $p\\geq e(H)$, denoted by $t(H,W)$. One may then define corresponding functionals $\\|W\\|_{H}:=|t(H,W)|^{1/e(H)}$ and $\\|W\\|_{r(H)}:=t(H,|W|)^{1/e(H)}$ and say that $H$ is (semi-)norming if $\\|.\\|_{H}$ is a (semi-)norm and that $H$ is weakly norming if $\\|.\\|_{r(H)}$ is a norm. We obtain two results that contribute to the theory of (weakly) norming graphs. Firstly, answering a question of Hatami, who estimated the modulus of convexity and smoothness of $\\|.\\|_{H}$, we prove that $\\|.\\|_{r(H)}$ is not uniformly convex nor uniformly smooth, provided that $H$ is weakly norming. Secondly, we prove that every graph $H$ without isolated vertices is (weakly) norming if and only if each component is an isomorphic copy of a (weakly) norming graph. This strong factorisation result allows us to assume connectivity of $H$ when studying graph norms. In particular, we correct an error in the original statement of the aforementioned theorem by Hatami.", "field": "math", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Deep Automated Mechanism Design for Integrating Ad Auction and Allocation in Feed\nAbstract: E-commerce platforms usually present an ordered list, mixed with several organic items and an advertisement, in response to each user's page view request. This list, the outcome of ad auction and allocation processes, directly impacts the platform's ad revenue and gross merchandise volume (GMV). Specifically, the ad auction determines which ad is displayed and the corresponding payment, while the ad allocation decides the display positions of the advertisement and organic items. The prevalent methods of segregating the ad auction and allocation into two distinct stages face two problems: 1) Ad auction does not consider externalities, such as the influence of actual display position and context on ad Click-Through Rate (CTR); 2) The ad allocation, which utilizes the auction-winning ad's payment to determine the display position dynamically, fails to maintain incentive compatibility (IC) for the advertisement. For instance, in the auction stage employing the traditional Generalized Second Price (GSP) , even if the winning ad increases its bid, its payment remains unchanged. This implies that the advertisement cannot secure a better position and thus loses the opportunity to achieve higher utility in the subsequent ad allocation stage. Previous research often focused on one of the two stages, neglecting the two-stage problem, which may result in suboptimal outcomes...", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: An eigenvalue problem for self-similar patterns in Hele-Shaw flows\nAbstract: Hele-Shaw problems are prototypes to study the interface dynamics. Linear theory suggests the existence of self-similar patterns in a Hele-Shaw flow. That is, with a specific injection flux the interface shape remains unchanged while its size increases. In this paper, we explore the existence of self-similar patterns in the nonlinear regime and develop a rigorous nonlinear theory characterizing their fundamental features. Using a boundary integral formulation, we pose the question of self-similarity as a generalized nonlinear eigenvalue problem, involving two nonlinear integral operators. The flux constant $C$ is the eigenvalue and the corresponding self-similar pattern $\\mathbf{x}$ is the eigenvector. We develop a quasi-Newton method to solve the problem and show the existence of nonlinear shapes with $k$-fold dominated symmetries. The influence of initial guesses on the self-similar patterns is investigated. We are able to obtain a desired self-similar shape once the initial guess is properly chosen.

{"text": "Title: Radar-Camera Pixel Depth Association for Depth Completion\nAbstract: While radar and video data can be readily fused at the detection level, fusing them at the pixel level is potentially more beneficial. This is also more challenging in part due to the sparsity of radar, but also because automotive radar beams are much wider than a typical pixel combined with a large baseline between camera and radar, which results in poor association between radar pixels and color pixel. A consequence is that depth completion methods designed for LiDAR and video fare poorly for radar and video. Here we propose a radar-to-pixel association stage which learns a mapping from radar returns to pixels. This mapping also serves to densify radar returns. Using this as a first stage, followed by a more traditional depth completion method, we are able to achieve image-guided depth completion with radar and video.

Given a point robot moving with bounded speed among transient rectilinear obstacles and a pair of points $s$, $d$, we determine a time-minimal, obstacle-avoiding path from $s$ to $d$. The main challenge in solving this problem arises as the robot may be required to wait for an obstacle to disappear, before it can continue moving toward the destination. Our algorithm builds on the continuous Dijkstra paradigm, which simulates propagating a wavefront from the source point. We also solve a query version of this problem.

Previous attempts to combat spam mainly employ features related to metadata, user behaviors, or relational ties. These works have made considerable progress in understanding and filtering spamming campaigns. However, this problem remains far from fully solved. Almost all the proposed features focus on a limited number of observed attributes or explainable phenomena, making it difficult for existing methods to achieve further improvement. To broaden the vision about solving the spam problem and address long-standing challenges (class imbalance and graph incompleteness) in the spam detection area, we propose a new attempt of utilizing signed latent factors to filter fraudulent activities. The spam-contaminated relational datasets of multiple online applications in this scenario are interpreted by the unified signed network. Two competitive and highly dissimilar algorithms of latent factors mining (LFM) models are designed based on multi-relational likelihoods estimation (LFM-MRLE) and signed pairwise ranking (LFM-SPR), respectively. We then explore how to apply the mined latent factors to spam detection tasks.

{"text": "Title: Coalition Formation Games for Collaborative Spectrum Sensing\nAbstract: Collaborative Spectrum Sensing (CSS) between secondary users (SUs) in cognitive networks exhibits an inherent tradeoff between minimizing the probability of missing the detection of the primary user (PU) and maintaining a reasonable false alarm probability (e.g., for maintaining a good spectrum utilization). In this paper, we study the impact of this tradeoff on the network structure and the cooperative incentives of the SUs that seek to cooperate for improving their detection performance. We model the CSS problem as a non-transferable coalitional game, and we propose distributed algorithms for coalition formation. First, we construct a distributed coalition formation (CF) algorithm that allows the SUs to self-organize into disjoint coalitions while accounting for the CSS tradeoff. Then, the CF algorithm is complemented with a coalitional voting game for enabling distributed coalition formation with detection probability guarantees (CF-PD) when required by the PU. The CF-PD algorithm allows the SUs to form minimal winning coalitions (MWCs), i.e., coalitions that achieve the target detection probability with minimal costs. For both algorithms, we study and prove various properties pertaining to network structure, adaptation to mobility and stability. Simulation results show that CF reduces the average probability of miss per SU up to 88.45% relative to the non-cooperative case, while maintaining a desired false alarm. For CF-PD, the results show that up to 87.25% of the SUs achieve the required detection probability through MWC", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

The majority of multimodal rumor detection methods mainly concentrate on extracting features of source claims and their corresponding images, while ignoring the comments of rumors and their propagation structures. These comments and structures imply the wisdom of crowds and are proved to be crucial to debunk rumors.

Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel Vision and Graph Fused Attention Network (VGA) for rumor detection to utilize propagation structures among posts so as to obtain the crowd opinions and further explore visual tampering features, as well as the textual information hidden in images.

The main theorem is formulated in more general settings, namely for any discrete process with uniformly bounded increments which admits a regeneration structure where the regeneration times have finite moments. Here the largest finite moment translates into the degree of regularity of the rough path topology. In particular, the convergence holds in the $\\alpha$-H\\\"older rough path topology for all $\\alpha<1/2$ whenever all moments are finite, which is the case for the class of ballistic random walks in random environment.

{"text": "Title: Nonconvex bundle method with application to a delamination problem\nAbstract: Delamination is a typical failure mode of composite materials caused by weak bonding. It arises when a crack initiates and propagates under a destructive loading. Given the physical law characterizing the properties of the interlayer adhesive between the bonded bodies, we consider the problem of computing the propagation of the crack front and the stress field along the contact boundary. This leads to a hemivariational inequality, which after discretization by finite elements we solve by a nonconvex bundle method, where upper-$C^1$ criteria have to be minimized. As this is in contrast with other classes of mechanical problems with non-monotone friction laws and in other applied fields, where criteria are typically lower-$C^1$, we propose a bundle method suited for both types of nonsmoothness. We prove its global convergence in the sense of subsequences and test it on a typical delamination problem of material sciences.", "field": "math", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: HawkRover: An Autonomous mmWave Vehicular Communication Testbed with Multi-sensor Fusion and Deep Learning\nAbstract: Connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) have become a transformative technology that can change our daily life. Currently, millimeter-wave (mmWave) bands are identified as the promising CAV connectivity solution. While it can provide high data rate, their realization faces many challenges such as high attenuation during mmWave signal propagation and mobility management. Existing solution has to initiate pilot signal to measure channel information, then apply signal processing to calculate the best narrow beam towards the receiver end to guarantee sufficient signal power. This process takes significant overhead and time, hence not suitable for vehicles. In this study, we propose an autonomous and low-cost testbed to collect extensive co-located mmWave signal and other sensors data such as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), cameras, ultrasonic, etc, traditionally for ``automated'', to facilitate mmWave vehicular communications. Intuitively, these sensors can build a 3D map around the vehicle and signal propagation path can be estimated, eliminating iterative the process via pilot signals.

{"text": "Title: Trajectory-Oriented Policy Optimization with Sparse Rewards\nAbstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) remains challenging in tasks with sparse rewards. These sparse rewards often only indicate whether the task is partially or fully completed, meaning that many exploration actions must be performed before the agent obtains useful feedback. Hence, most existing DRL algorithms fail to learn feasible policies within a reasonable time frame. To overcome this problem, we develop an approach that exploits offline demonstration trajectories for faster and more efficient online RL in sparse reward settings. Our key insight is that by regarding offline demonstration trajectories as guidance, instead of imitating them, our method learns a policy whose state-action visitation marginal distribution matches that of offline demonstrations. Specifically, we introduce a novel trajectory distance based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and formulate policy optimization as a distance-constrained optimization problem. Then, we show that this distance-constrained optimization problem can be reduced into a policy-gradient algorithm with shaped rewards learned from offline demonstrations. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on extensive discrete and continuous control tasks with sparse and deceptive rewards. The experimental results indicate that our proposed algorithm is significantly better than the baseline methods regarding diverse exploration and learning the optimal policy.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Introducing an experimental distortion-tolerant speech encryption scheme for secure voice communication\nAbstract: The current increasing need for privacy-preserving voice communications is leading to new ideas for securing voice transmission. This paper refers to a relatively new concept of sending encrypted speech as pseudo-speech in the audio domain over digital voice communication infrastructures, like 3G cellular network and VoIP. This work presents a novel distortion-tolerant speech encryption scheme for secure voice communications over voice channels that combines the robustness of analog speech scrambling and elevated security offered by digital ciphers like AES-CTR. The system scrambles vocal parameters of a speech signal (loudness, pitch, timbre) using distance-preserving pseudo-random translations and rotations on a hypersphere of parameters. Next, scrambled parameters are encoded to a pseudo-speech signal adapted to transmission over digital voice channels equipped with voice activity detection. Upon reception of this pseudo-speech signal, the legitimate receiver restores distorted copies of the initial vocal parameters. Despite some deciphering errors, an integrated neural-based vocoder based on the LPCNet architecture reconstructs an intelligible speech. The experimental implementation of this speech encryption scheme has been tested by simulations and sending an encrypted signal over FaceTime between two iPhones 6 connected to the same WiFi network. Moreover, speech excerpts restored from encrypted signals were evaluated by a speech quality assessment on a group of about 40 participants. The experiments demonstrated that the proposed scheme produces intelligible speech with a gracefully progressive quality degradation depending on the channel noise. Finally, the preliminary computational analysis suggested that the presented setting may operate on high-end portable devices in nearly real-time.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Kempe equivalence and quadratic toric rings\nAbstract: Perfectly contractile graphs form a typical class of perfect graphs. In particular, all $k$-colorings of a perfectly contractile graph are Kempe equivalent. Everett and Reed conjectured that a graph is perfectly contractile if and only if it contains no odd holes, no antiholes and no odd prisms. On the other hand the authors and Shibata conjectured that a perfect graph is perfectly contractile if and only if its toric ring, which is called the stable set ring, is quadratic. In the present paper, we characterize when the stable set ring of a (not necessarily perfect) graph is quadratic by using Kempe equivalence. As applications of this characterization, we can claim that if Everett and Reed conjecture is true, then the conjecture of the authors and Shibata is also true. Moreover, we can show that for several important classes of perfectly contractile graphs, the stable set rings are quadratic.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Hyperbolic Graph Diffusion Model\nAbstract: Diffusion generative models (DMs) have achieved promising results in image and graph generation. However, real-world graphs, such as social networks, molecular graphs, and traffic graphs, generally share non-Euclidean topologies and hidden hierarchies. For example, the degree distributions of graphs are mostly power-law distributions. The current latent diffusion model embeds the hierarchical data in a Euclidean space, which leads to distortions and interferes with modeling the distribution. Instead, hyperbolic space has been found to be more suitable for capturing complex hierarchical structures due to its exponential growth property. In order to simultaneously utilize the data generation capabilities of diffusion models and the ability of hyperbolic embeddings to extract latent hierarchical distributions, we propose a novel graph generation method called, Hyperbolic Graph Diffusion Model (HGDM), which consists of an auto-encoder to encode nodes into successive hyperbolic embeddings, and a DM that operates in the hyperbolic latent space. HGDM captures the crucial graph structure distributions by constructing a hyperbolic potential node space that incorporates edge information. Extensive experiments show that HGDM achieves better performance in generic graph and molecule generation benchmarks, with a $48\\%$ improvement in the quality of graph generation with highly hierarchical structures.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

For Kelvin waves sufficiently close to the disc, we prove a nonlinear stability result up to an arbitrarily long time in the $L^1$ norm of the vorticity, for $m$-fold symmetric perturbations. To obtain this result, we first prove that the Kelvin wave is a strict local maximizer of the energy functional in some admissible class of patches, which had been claimed by Wan in 1986. This gives an orbital stability result with a support condition on the evolution of perturbations, but using a Lagrangian bootstrap argument which traces the particle trajectories of the perturbation, we are able to drop the condition on the evolution. Based on this unconditional stability result, we establish that long time filamentation, or formation of long arms, occurs near the Kelvin waves, which have been observed in various numerical simulations.

{"text": "Title: Predicting parametric spatiotemporal dynamics by multi-resolution PDE structure-preserved deep learning\nAbstract: Pure data-driven deep learning models suffer from high training costs, error accumulation, and poor generalizability when predicting complex physical processes. A more promising way is to leverage our prior physics knowledge in scientific deep learning models, known as physics-informed deep learning (PiDL). In most PiDL frameworks, the physics prior is utilized to regularize neural network training by incorporating governing equations into the loss function. The resulting physical constraint, imposed in a soft manner, relies heavily on a proper setting of hyperparameters that weigh each loss term. To this end, we propose a new direction to leverage physics prior knowledge by ``baking'' the mathematical structure of governing equations into the neural network architecture, namely PDE-preserved neural network (PPNN). The discretized PDE is preserved in PPNN as convolutional residual networks formulated in a multi-resolution setting. This physics-inspired learning architecture endows PPNN with excellent generalizability and long-term prediction accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art black-box baselines.

{"text": "Title: Bounded diameter tree-decompositions\nAbstract: When does a graph admit a tree-decomposition in which every bag has small diameter? For finite graphs, this is a property of interest in algorithmic graph theory, where it is called having bounded ``tree-length''. We will show that this is equivalent to being ``boundedly quasi-isometric to a tree'', which for infinite graphs is a much-studied property from metric geometry. One object of this paper is to tie these two areas together. We will prove that there is a tree-decomposition in which each bag has small diameter, if and only if there is a map $\\phi$ from $V(G)$ into the vertex set of a tree $T$, such that for all $u,v\\in V(G)$, the distances $d_G(u,v), d_T(\\phi(u),\\phi(v))$ differ by at most a constant. A ``geodesic loaded cycle'' in $G$ is a pair $(C,F)$, where $C$ is a cycle of $G$ and $F\\subseteq E(C)$, such that for every pair $u,v$ of vertices of $C$, one of the paths of $C$ between $u,v$ contains at most $d_G(u,v)$ $F$-edges, where $d_G(u,v)$ is the distance between $u,v$ in $G$. We will show that a graph $G$ admits a tree-decomposition in which every bag has small diameter, if and only if $|F|$ is small for every geodesic loaded cycle $(C,F)$. Our proof is an extension of an algorithm to approximate tree-length in finite graphs by Dourisboure and Gavoille. In metric geometry, there is a similar theorem that characterizes when a graph is quasi-isometric to a tree, ``Manning's bottleneck criterion''. The goal of this paper is to tie all these concepts together, and add a few more related ideas. For instance, we prove a conjecture of Rose McCarty, that $G$ admits a tree-decomposition in which every bag has small diameter, if and only if for all vertices $u,v,w$ of $G$, some ball of small radius meets every path joining two of $u,v,w$.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Economics Arena for Large Language Models\nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used as the backbones for general-purpose agents, and some economics literature suggest that LLMs are capable of playing various types of economics games. Following these works, to overcome the limitation of evaluating LLMs using static benchmarks, we propose to explore competitive games as an evaluation for LLMs to incorporate multi-players and dynamicise the environment. By varying the game history revealed to LLMs-based players, we find that most of LLMs are rational in that they play strategies that can increase their payoffs, but not as rational as indicated by Nash Equilibria (NEs). Moreover, when game history are available, certain types of LLMs, such as GPT-4, can converge faster to the NE strategies, which suggests higher rationality level in comparison to other models. In the meantime, certain types of LLMs can win more often when game history are available, and we argue that the winning rate reflects the reasoning ability with respect to the strategies of other players. Throughout all our experiments, we observe that the ability to strictly follow the game rules described by natural languages also vary among the LLMs we tested. In this work, we provide an economics arena for the LLMs research community as a dynamic simulation to test the above-mentioned abilities of LLMs, i.e. rationality, strategic reasoning ability, and instruction-following capability.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: High-Resolution Image Inpainting with Iterative Confidence Feedback and Guided Upsampling\nAbstract: Existing image inpainting methods often produce artifacts when dealing with large holes in real applications. To address this challenge, we propose an iterative inpainting method with a feedback mechanism. Specifically, we introduce a deep generative model which not only outputs an inpainting result but also a corresponding confidence map. Using this map as feedback, it progressively fills the hole by trusting only high-confidence pixels inside the hole at each iteration and focuses on the remaining pixels in the next iteration. As it reuses partial predictions from the previous iterations as known pixels, this process gradually improves the result. In addition, we propose a guided upsampling network to enable generation of high-resolution inpainting results. We achieve this by extending the Contextual Attention module to borrow high-resolution feature patches in the input image. Furthermore, to mimic real object removal scenarios, we collect a large object mask dataset and synthesize more realistic training data that better simulates user inputs. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

For a general Bayesian inference problem, we first show that the iteration of the common second-order natural parameter (SONP) is separated from that of the common first-order natural parameter (FONP). Hence, the convergence of the common SONP can be checked independently. We show that with the initialization satisfying a specific but large range, the common SONP is convergent regardless of the value of the damping factor. For the common FONP, we establish a sufficient condition of its convergence and prove that the convergence of the common FONP relies on the spectral radius of a particular matrix related to the damping factor. We give the range of the damping factor that guarantees the convergence in the worst case. Further, we determine the range of the damping factor for massive MIMO-OFDM channel estimation by using the specific properties of the measurement matrices.

We showed that the heat invariants of the $0$-spectrum together with those of the $1$-spectrum for the corresponding Hodge Laplacians are sufficient to distinguish orbifolds from manifolds as long as the singular sets have codimension $\\le 3.$ This is enough to distinguish orbifolds from manifolds for dimension $\\le 3.$ Here we give both positive and negative inverse spectral results for the individual $p$-spectra considered separately.

{"text": "Title: Looking forwards and backwards: dynamics and genealogies of locally regulated populations\nAbstract: We introduce a broad class of spatial models to describe how spatially heterogeneous populations live, die, and reproduce. Individuals are represented by points of a point measure, whose birth and death rates can depend both on spatial position and local population density, defined via the convolution of the point measure with a nonnegative kernel. We pass to three different scaling limits: an interacting superprocess, a nonlocal partial differential equation (PDE), and a classical PDE. The classical PDE is obtained both by first scaling time and population size to pass to the nonlocal PDE, and then scaling the kernel that determines local population density; and also (when the limit is a reaction-diffusion equation) by simultaneously scaling the kernel width, timescale and population size in our individual based model. A novelty of our model is that we explicitly model a juvenile phase: offspring are thrown off in a Gaussian distribution around the location of the parent, and reach (instant) maturity with a probability that can depend on the population density at the location at which they land. Although we only record mature individuals, a trace of this two-step description remains in our population models, resulting in novel limits governed by a nonlinear diffusion. Using a lookdown representation, we retain information about genealogies and, in the case of deterministic limiting models, use this to deduce the backwards in time motion of the ancestral lineage of a sampled individual. We observe that knowing the history of the population density is not enough to determine the motion of ancestral lineages in our model. We also investigate the behaviour of lineages for three different deterministic models of a population expanding its range as a travelling wave: the Fisher-KPP equation, the Allen-Cahn equation, and a porous medium equation with logistic growth.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

Absolute undecidability is a weakening of bi-immunity. Downey, Jockusch and Schupp asked whether, unlike the case for bi-immunity, there is an absolutely undecidable set in every non-zero Turing degree. We provide a positive answer to this question by applying techniques from coding theory. We show how to use Walsh-Hadamard codes to build a truth-table functional which maps any sequence A to a sequence B, such that given any restriction of B to a set of positive upper density, one can recover A. This implies that if A is non-computable, then B is absolutely undecidable.

{"text": "Title: Stress and Adaptation: Applying Anna Karenina Principle in Deep Learning for Image Classification\nAbstract: Image classification with deep neural networks has reached state-of-art with high accuracy. This success is attributed to good internal representation features that bypasses the difficulties of the non-convex optimization problems. We have little understanding of these internal representations, let alone quantifying them. Recent research efforts have focused on alternative theories and explanations of the generalizability of these deep networks. We propose the alternative perturbation of deep models during their training induces changes that lead to transitions to different families. The result is an Anna Karenina Principle AKP for deep learning, in which less generalizable models unhappy families vary more in their representation than more generalizable models happy families paralleling Leo Tolstoy dictum that all happy families look alike, each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. Anna Karenina principle has been found in systems in a wide range: from the surface of endangered corals exposed to harsh weather to the lungs of patients suffering from fatal diseases of AIDs. In our paper, we have generated artificial perturbations to our model by hot-swapping the activation and loss functions during the training.

{"text": "Title: Fractal geometry of the space-time difference profile in the directed landscape via construction of geodesic local times\nAbstract: The Directed Landscape, a random directed metric on the plane (where the first and the second coordinates are termed spatial and temporal respectively), was constructed in the breakthrough work of Dauvergne, Ortmann, and Vir\\'ag, and has since been shown to be the scaling limit of various integrable models of Last Passage percolation, a central member of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. It exhibits several scale invariance properties making it a natural source of rich fractal behavior. Such a study was initiated in Basu-Ganguly-Hammond, where the difference profile i.e., the difference of passage times from two fixed points (say $(\\pm 1,0)$), was considered. Owing to geodesic geometry, it turns out that this difference process is almost surely locally constant. The set of non-constancy is connected to disjointness of geodesics and inherits remarkable fractal properties. In particular, it has been established that when only the spatial coordinate is varied, the set of non-constancy of the difference profile has Hausdorff dimension $1/2$, and bears a rather strong resemblance to the zero set of Brownian motion. The arguments crucially rely on a monotonicity property, which is absent when the temporal structure of the process is probed, necessitating the development of new methods. In this paper, we put forth several new ideas, and show that the set of non-constancy of the 2D difference profile and the 1D temporal process (when the spatial coordinate is fixed and the temporal coordinate is varied) have Hausdorff dimensions $5/3$ and $2/3$ respectively. A particularly crucial ingredient in our analysis is the novel construction of a local time process for the geodesic akin to Brownian local time, supported on the \"zero set\" of the geodesic. Further, we show that the latter has Hausdorff dimension $1/3$ in contrast to the zero set of Brownian motion which has dimension $1/2.$", "field": "math", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Beyond Regrets: Geometric Metrics for Bayesian Optimization\nAbstract: Bayesian optimization is a principled optimization strategy for a black-box objective function. It shows its effectiveness in a wide variety of real-world applications such as scientific discovery and experimental design. In general, the performance of Bayesian optimization is assessed by regret-based metrics such as instantaneous, simple, and cumulative regrets. These metrics only rely on function evaluations, so that they do not consider geometric relationships between query points and global solutions, or query points themselves. Notably, they cannot discriminate if multiple global solutions are successfully found. Moreover, they do not evaluate Bayesian optimization's abilities to exploit and explore a search space given. To tackle these issues, we propose four new geometric metrics, i.e., precision, recall, average degree, and average distance. These metrics allow us to compare Bayesian optimization algorithms considering the geometry of both query points and global optima, or query points. However, they are accompanied by an extra parameter, which needs to be carefully determined. We therefore devise the parameter-free forms of the respective metrics by integrating out the additional parameter. Finally, we empirically validate that our proposed metrics can provide more convincing interpretation and understanding of Bayesian optimization algorithms from distinct perspectives, compared to the conventional metrics.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

Our study reveals that corporate misinformation encompasses topics such as products, politics, and societal issues. We discovered companies affected by fake news also get reputable news coverage but less social media attention, leading to heightened negativity in social media comments, diminished stock growth, and increased stress mentions among employee reviews.

Some paradigms have been recently developed to explore this adversarial phenomenon occurring at different stages of a machine learning system, such as backdoor attack occurring at the pre-training, in-training and inference stage; weight attack occurring at the post-training, deployment and inference stage; adversarial attack occurring at the inference stage. However, although these adversarial paradigms share a common goal, their developments are almost independent, and there is still no big picture of AML. In this work, we aim to provide a unified perspective to the AML community to systematically review the overall progress of this field. We firstly provide a general definition about AML, and then propose a unified mathematical framework to covering existing attack paradigms. According to the proposed unified framework, we build a full taxonomy to systematically categorize and review existing representative methods for each paradigm. Besides, using this unified framework, it is easy to figure out the connections and differences among different attack paradigms, which may inspire future researchers to develop more advanced attack paradigms. Finally, to facilitate the viewing of the built taxonomy and the related literature in adversarial machine learning, we further provide a website, \\ie, \\url{http://adversarial-ml.com}, where the taxonomies and literature will be continuously updated.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Fluctuation of the Largest Eigenvalue of a Kernel Matrix with application in Graphon-based Random Graphs\nAbstract: In this article, we explore the spectral properties of general random kernel matrices $[K(U_i,U_j)]_{1\\leq i\\neq j\\leq n}$ from a Lipschitz kernel $K$ with $n$ independent random variables $U_1,U_2,\\ldots, U_n$ distributed uniformly over $[0,1]$. In particular we identify a dichotomy in the extreme eigenvalue of the kernel matrix, where, if the kernel $K$ is degenerate, the largest eigenvalue of the kernel matrix (after proper normalization) converges weakly to a weighted sum of independent chi-squared random variables. In contrast, for non-degenerate kernels, it converges to a normal distribution extending and reinforcing earlier results from Koltchinskii and Gin\\'e (2000). Further, we apply this result to show a dichotomy in the asymptotic behavior of extreme eigenvalues of $W$-random graphs, which are pivotal in modeling complex networks and analyzing large-scale graph behavior. These graphs are generated using a kernel $W$, termed as graphon, by connecting vertices $i$ and $j$ with probability $W(U_i, U_j)$. Our results show that for a Lipschitz graphon $W$, if the degree function is constant, the fluctuation of the largest eigenvalue (after proper normalization) converges to the weighted sum of independent chi-squared random variables and an independent normal distribution. Otherwise, it converges to a normal distribution.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Minimum Weight Pairwise Distance Preservers\nAbstract: In this paper, we study the Minimum Weight Pairwise Distance Preservers (MWPDP) problem. Consider a positively weighted undirected/directed connected graph $G = (V, E, c)$ and a subset $P$ of pairs of vertices, also called demand pairs. A subgraph $G'$ is a distance preserver with respect to $P$ if and only if every pair $(u, w) \\in P$ satisfies $dist_{G'} (u, w) = dist_{G}(u, w)$. In MWPDP problem, we aim to find the minimum-weight subgraph $G^*$ that is a distance preserver with respect to $P$. Taking a shortest path between each pair in $P$ gives us a trivial solution with the weight of at most $U=\\sum_{(u,v) \\in P} dist_{G} (u, w)$. Subsequently, we ask how much improvement we can make upon $U$. In other words, we opt to find a distance preserver $G^*$ that maximizes $U-c(G^*)$. Denote this problem as Cost Sharing Pairwise Distance Preservers (CSPDP), which has several applications in the planning and operations of transportation systems. The only known work that can provide a nontrivial solution for CSPDP is that of Chlamt\\'a\\v{c} et al. (SODA, 2017). This algorithm works for unweighted graphs and guarantees a non-zero objective only if the optimal solution is extremely sparse with respect to the trivial solution. We address this issue by proposing an $O(|E|^{1/2+\\epsilon})$-approximation algorithm for CSPDP in weighted graphs that runs in $O((|P||E|)^{2.38} (1/\\epsilon))$ time. Moreover, we prove CSPDP is at least as hard as $\\text{LABEL-COVER}_{\\max}$.

{"text": "Title: Prompt Decoupling for Text-to-Image Person Re-identification\nAbstract: Text-to-image person re-identification (TIReID) aims to retrieve the target person from an image gallery via a textual description query. Recently, pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have attracted significant attention and have been widely utilized for this task due to their robust capacity for semantic concept learning and rich multi-modal knowledge. However, recent CLIP-based TIReID methods commonly rely on direct fine-tuning of the entire network to adapt the CLIP model for the TIReID task. Although these methods show competitive performance on this topic, they are suboptimal as they necessitate simultaneous domain adaptation and task adaptation. To address this issue, we attempt to decouple these two processes during the training stage. Specifically, we introduce the prompt tuning strategy to enable domain adaptation and propose a two-stage training approach to disentangle domain adaptation from task adaptation. In the first stage, we freeze the two encoders from CLIP and solely focus on optimizing the prompts to alleviate domain gap between the original training data of CLIP and downstream tasks. In the second stage, we maintain the fixed prompts and fine-tune the CLIP model to prioritize capturing fine-grained information, which is more suitable for TIReID task. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method on three widely used datasets. Compared to the directly fine-tuned approach, our method achieves significant improvements.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

Only $\\alpha$-locally differentially private (LDP) samples $z_1,...,z_n$ are publicly available, where the term 'local' means that each $z_i$ is produced using one individual attribute $x_i$.

We compile two CDS corpora with sentential logical forms, one in English and the other in Hebrew. In compiling the corpora we employ a methodology that enforces a cross-linguistically consistent representation, building on recent advances in dependency representation and semantic parsing. The corpora are based on a sizable portion of Brown's Adam corpus from CHILDES (about 80% of its child-directed utterances), and to all child-directed utterances from Berman's Hebrew CHILDES corpus Hagar. We begin by annotating the corpora with the Universal Dependencies (UD) scheme for syntactic annotation, motivated by its applicability to a wide variety of domains and languages. We then proceed by applying an automatic method for transducing sentential logical forms (LFs) from UD structures. The two representations have complementary strengths: UD structures are language-neutral and support direct annotation, whereas LFs are neutral as to the interface between syntax and semantics, and transparently encode semantic distinctions. We verify the quality of the annotated UD annotation using an inter-annotator agreement study. We then demonstrate the utility of the compiled corpora through a longitudinal corpus study of the prevalence of different syntactic and semantic phenomena.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

A related consequence is that the Borel chromatic number of $\\mathrm{Free}(2^G)$ is the maximum among Borel chromatic numbers of free actions of $G$. This answers a question of Marks. Our construction is flexible and, using an appropriate notion of genericity, we are able to show that in fact the generic $G$-equivariant map to $2^G$ lands in the free part.

We exploit a new topology to model the network, where the node locations of LoRa follow a Poisson cluster process (PCP) while other coexisting radio modules follow a Poisson point process (PPP). Unlike most of the performance analysis based on stochastic geometry, we take noise into consideration. More specifically, two models, with a fixed and a random number of active LoRa nodes in each cluster, respectively, are considered. To obtain insights, both the exact and simple approximated expressions for coverage probability are derived. Based on them, area spectral efficiency and energy efficiency are obtained. From our analysis, we show how the performance of LPWA networks can be enhanced through adjusting the density of LoRa nodes around each LoRa receiver. Moreover, the simulation results unveil that the optimal number of active LoRa nodes in each cluster exists to maximize the area spectral efficiency.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

The $n=3$ case has been addressed in [30], while in dimension $n \\geq 4$, as we know, negative Einstein metrics in general have non-trivial moduli spaces. This fact is reflected on the structure of Einstein equations, which further indicates no decay for the spatial Weyl tensor. Furthermore, it is suggested in the proof that the mechanic preventing the metric from flowing back to the original Einstein metric lies in the non-decaying character of spatial Weyl tensor. In contrary to the compact case considered in Andersson-Moncrief [4], our proof is independent of the theory of infinitesimal Einstein deformations. Instead, we take advantage of the inherent geometric structures of Einstein equations and develop an approach of energy estimates for a hyperbolic system of Maxwell type.", "field": "math", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Wasserstein Nonnegative Tensor Factorization with Manifold Regularization\nAbstract: Nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF) has become an important tool for feature extraction and part-based representation with preserved intrinsic structure information from nonnegative high-order data. However, the original NTF methods utilize Euclidean or Kullback-Leibler divergence as the loss function which treats each feature equally leading to the neglect of the side-information of features. To utilize correlation information of features and manifold information of samples, we introduce Wasserstein manifold nonnegative tensor factorization (WMNTF), which minimizes the Wasserstein distance between the distribution of input tensorial data and the distribution of reconstruction. Although some researches about Wasserstein distance have been proposed in nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), they ignore the spatial structure information of higher-order data.

{"text": "Title: Universality in block dependent linear models with applications to nonparametric regression\nAbstract: Over the past decade, characterizing the exact asymptotic risk of regularized estimators in high-dimensional regression has emerged as a popular line of work. This literature considers the proportional asymptotics framework, where the number of features and samples both diverge, at a rate proportional to each other. Substantial work in this area relies on Gaussianity assumptions on the observed covariates. Further, these studies often assume the design entries to be independent and identically distributed. Parallel research investigates the universality of these findings, revealing that results based on the i.i.d.~Gaussian assumption extend to a broad class of designs, such as i.i.d.~sub-Gaussians. However, universality results examining dependent covariates so far focused on correlation-based dependence or a highly structured form of dependence, as permitted by right rotationally invariant designs. In this paper, we break this barrier and study a dependence structure that in general falls outside the purview of these established classes. We seek to pin down the extent to which results based on i.i.d.~Gaussian assumptions persist. We identify a class of designs characterized by a block dependence structure that ensures the universality of i.i.d.~Gaussian-based results. We establish that the optimal values of the regularized empirical risk and the risk associated with convex regularized estimators, such as the Lasso and ridge, converge to the same limit under block dependent designs as they do for i.i.d.~Gaussian entry designs. Our dependence structure differs significantly from correlation-based dependence, and enables, for the first time, asymptotically exact risk characterization in prevalent nonparametric regression problems in high dimensions.

{"text": "Title: Tuple-Independent Representations of Infinite Probabilistic Databases\nAbstract: Probabilistic databases (PDBs) are probability spaces over database instances. They provide a framework for handling uncertainty in databases, as occurs due to data integration, noisy data, data from unreliable sources or randomized processes. Most of the existing theory literature investigated finite, tuple-independent PDBs (TI-PDBs) where the occurrences of tuples are independent events. Only recently, Grohe and Lindner (PODS '19) introduced independence assumptions for PDBs beyond the finite domain assumption. In the finite, a major argument for discussing the theoretical properties of TI-PDBs is that they can be used to represent any finite PDB via views. This is no longer the case once the number of tuples is countably infinite. In this paper, we systematically study the representability of infinite PDBs in terms of TI-PDBs and the related block-independent disjoint PDBs. The central question is which infinite PDBs are representable as first-order views over tuple-independent PDBs. We give a necessary condition for the representability of PDBs and provide a sufficient criterion for representability in terms of the probability distribution of a PDB. With various examples, we explore the limits of our criteria. We show that conditioning on first order properties yields no additional power in terms of expressivity.

Sparse coding models have achieved great success in explaining the receptive fields of mammalian primary visual cortex with sparsely activated latent representation. In this paper, we focus on a recently proposed model, sparse coding variational autoencoder (SVAE) (Barello et al., 2018), and show that the end-to-end training scheme of SVAE leads to a large group of decoding filters not fully optimized with noise-like receptive fields. We propose a few heuristics to improve the training of SVAE and show that a unit $L_2$ norm constraint on the decoder is critical to produce sparse coding filters. Such normalization can be considered as local lateral inhibition in the cortex. We verify this claim empirically on both natural image patches and MNIST dataset and show that projection of the filters onto unit norm drastically increases the number of active filters.

A system is said to be a genuine weakly hyperbolic if all eigenvalues are real with no complete set of linearly independent (LI) eigenvectors. To construct an upwind solver based on flux difference splitting (FDS) framework, we require to generate complete set of LI eigenvectors. This can be done through addition of generalized eigenvectors which can be computed from theory of Jordan canonical forms. Once we have complete set of LI generalized eigenvectors, we construct upwind solvers in convection-pressure splitting framework. Since generalized eigenvectors are not unique, we take extra care to ensure no direct contribution of generalized eigenvectors in the final formulation of both the newly developed numerical schemes.

{"text": "Title: Void Shape Identification in a 2D Point Distribution\nAbstract: We introduce a new approach for identifying and characterizing voids within two-dimensional (2D) point distributions through the integration of Delaunay triangulation and Voronoi diagrams, combined with a Minimal Distance Scoring algorithm. Our methodology initiates with the computational determination of the Convex Hull vertices within the point cloud, followed by a systematic selection of optimal line segments, strategically chosen for their likelihood of intersecting internal void regions. We then utilize Delaunay triangulation in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to ascertain the initial points for the construction of the maximal internal curve envelope by adopting a pseudo-recursive approach for higher-order void identification. In each iteration, the existing collection of maximal internal curve envelope points serves as a basis for identifying additional candidate points. This iterative process is inherently self-converging, ensuring progressive refinement of the void's shape with each successive computation cycle. The mathematical robustness of this method allows for an efficient convergence to a stable solution, reflecting both the geometric intricacies and the topological characteristics of the voids within the point cloud. Our findings introduce a method that aims to balance geometric accuracy with computational practicality. The approach is designed to improve the understanding of void shapes within point clouds and suggests a potential framework for exploring more complex, multi-dimensional data analysis.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

CTL+Sync augments CTL with temporal operators that require several paths to satisfy properties in a synchronous manner, e.g., the property \"all paths should eventually see $p$ at the same time\". The model-checking problem for CTL+Sync over finite-state Kripke structures was shown to be in $\\mathsf{P}^{\\mathsf{NP}^{\\mathsf{NP}}}$. OCAs are labelled transition systems equipped with a non-negative counter that can be zero-tested. Thus, they induce infinite-state systems whose computation trees are not regular. The model-checking problem for CTL over OCAs was shown to be $\\mathsf{PSPACE}$-complete. We show that the model-checking problem for CTL+Sync over OCAs is decidable. However, the upper bound we give is non-elementary. We therefore proceed to study the problem for a central fragment of CTL+Sync, extending CTL with operators that require all paths to satisfy properties in a synchronous manner, and show that it is in $\\mathsf{EXP}^\\mathsf{NEXP}$ (and in particular in $\\mathsf{EXPSPACE}$), by exhibiting a certain \"segmented periodicity\" in the computation trees of OCAs.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Taking Complete Finite Prefixes To High Level, Symbolically\nAbstract: Unfoldings are a well known partial-order semantics of P/T Petri nets that can be applied to various model checking or verification problems. For high-level Petri nets, the so-called symbolic unfolding generalizes this notion. A complete finite prefix of a P/T Petri net's unfolding contains all information to verify, e.g., reachability of markings. We unite these two concepts and define complete finite prefixes of the symbolic unfolding of high-level Petri nets. For a class of safe high-level Petri nets, we generalize the well-known algorithm by Esparza et al. for constructing small such prefixes. We evaluate this extended algorithm through a prototype implementation on four novel benchmark families. Additionally, we identify a more general class of nets with infinitely many reachable markings, for which an approach with an adapted cut-off criterion extends the complete prefix methodology, in the sense that the original algorithm cannot be applied to the P/T net represented by a high-level net.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Subtraction games in more than one dimension\nAbstract: This paper concerns two-player alternating play combinatorial games (Conway 1976) in the normal-play convention, i.e. last move wins. Specifically, we study impartial vector subtraction games on tuples of nonnegative integers (Golomb 1966), with finite subtraction sets. In case of two move rulesets we find a complete solution, via a certain \\P-to-\\P\\ principle (where \\P \\ means that the previous player wins). Namely $x \\in \\P$ if and only if $x +a +b \\in \\P$, where $a$ and $b$ are the two move options. Flammenkamp 1997 observed that, already in one dimension, rulesets with three moves can be hard to analyze, and still today his related conjecture remains open. Here, we solve instances of rulesets with three moves in two dimensions, and conjecture that they all have regular outcomes. Through several computer visualizations of outcomes of multi-move two-dimensional rulesets, we observe that they tend to partition the game board into periodic mosaics on very few regions/segments, which can depend on the number of moves in a ruleset. For example, we have found a five-move ruleset with an outcome segmentation into six semi-infinite slices. In this spirit, we develop a coloring automaton that generalizes the \\P-to-\\P\\ principle. Given an initial set of colored positions, it quickly paints the \\P-positions in segments of the game board. Moreover, we prove that two-dimensional rulesets have row/column eventually periodic outcomes. We pose open problems on the generic hardness of two-dimensional rulesets; several regularity conjectures are provided, but we also conjecture that not all rulesets have regular outcomes.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Online codes for analog signals\nAbstract: This paper revisits a classical scenario in communication theory: a waveform sampled at regular intervals is to be encoded so as to minimize distortion in its reconstruction, despite noise. This transformation must be online (causal), to enable real-time signaling; and should use no more power than the original signal. The noise model we consider is an \"atomic norm\" convex relaxation of the standard (discrete alphabet) Hamming-weight-bounded model: namely, adversarial $\\ell_1$-bounded. In the \"block coding\" (noncausal) setting, such encoding is possible due to the existence of large almost-Euclidean sections in $\\ell_1$ spaces, a notion first studied in the work of Dvoretzky in 1961. Our main result is that an analogous result is achievable even causally. Equivalently, our work may be seen as a \"lower triangular\" version of $\\ell_1$ Dvoretzky theorems. In terms of communication, the guarantees are expressed in terms of certain time-weighted norms: the time-weighted $\\ell_2$ norm imposed on the decoder forces increasingly accurate reconstruction of the distant past signal, while the time-weighted $\\ell_1$ norm on the noise ensures vanishing interference from distant past noise. Encoding is linear (hence easy to implement in analog hardware). Decoding is performed by an LP analogous to those used in compressed sensing.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: To Save Mobile Crowdsourcing from Cheap-talk: A Game Theoretic Learning Approach\nAbstract: Today mobile crowdsourcing platforms invite users to provide anonymous reviews about service experiences, yet many reviews are found biased to be extremely positive or negative. The existing methods find it difficult to learn from biased reviews to infer the actual service state, as the state can also be extreme and the platform cannot verify the truthfulness of reviews immediately. Further, reviewers can hide their (positive or negative) bias types and proactively adjust their anonymous reviews against the platform's inference. To our best knowledge, we are the first to study how to save mobile crowdsourcing from cheap-talk and strategically learn from biased users' reviews. We formulate the problem as a dynamic Bayesian game, including users' service-type messaging and the platform's follow-up rating/inference. Our closed-form PBE shows that an extremely-biased user may still honestly message to convince the platform of listening to his review. Such Bayesian game-theoretic learning obviously outperforms the latest common schemes especially when there are multiple diversely-biased users to compete. For the challenging single-user case, we further propose a time-evolving mechanism with the platform's commitment inferences to ensure the biased user's truthful messaging all the time, whose performance improves with more time periods to learn from more historical data.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

This is achieved by combining suitable fixed-point and energy arguments and by uncovering a nonlocal in time, integral conserved quantity. After giving a complete classification of steady states in terms of elliptic functions, we next show that every solution converges to a steady state as $t \\to \\infty$. When $\\epsilon \\to 0$, we then establish convergence results on finite time intervals, showing that the solution tends in a suitable sense towards the solution of a parabolic problem without delay.

{"text": "Title: Temporal Matrix Factorization for Tracking Concept Drift in Individual User Preferences\nAbstract: The matrix factorization (MF) technique has been widely adopted for solving the rating prediction problem in recommender systems. The MF technique utilizes the latent factor model to obtain static user preferences (user latent vectors) and item characteristics (item latent vectors) based on historical rating data. However, in the real world user preferences are not static but full of dynamics. Though there are several previous works that addressed this time varying issue of user preferences, it seems (to the best of our knowledge) that none of them is specifically designed for tracking concept drift in individual user preferences. Motivated by this, we develop a Temporal Matrix Factorization approach (TMF) for tracking concept drift in each individual user latent vector. There are two key innovative steps in our approach: (i) we develop a modified stochastic gradient descent method to learn an individual user latent vector at each time step, and (ii) by the Lasso regression we learn a linear model for the transition of the individual user latent vectors. We test our method on a synthetic dataset and several real datasets. In comparison with the original MF, our experimental results show that our temporal method is able to achieve lower root mean square errors (RMSE) for both the synthetic and real datasets. One interesting finding is that the performance gain in RMSE is mostly from those users who indeed have concept drift in their user latent vectors at the time of prediction. In particular, for the synthetic dataset and the Ciao dataset, there are quite a few users with that property and the performance gains for these two datasets are roughly 20% and 5%, respectively.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

In this paper, we introduce new agents (predators and altruists) that want to build houses once the settlement is already in the jammed state. Their behavior is governed by a different set of rules, and this allows them to build new houses even though the settlement is jammed. Our main focus is to detect jammed configurations that are resistant to predators, to altruists, and to both predators and altruists. We provide bivariate generating functions, and complexity functions (configurational entropies) for such jammed configurations.

Continuing the research on local ordered covering numbers, we introduce the local queue number of a graph $G$ as the minimum $\\ell$ such that $G$ admits a queue layout with each vertex having incident edges in no more than $\\ell$ queues. Similarly to the local page number [Merker, Ueckerdt, GD'19], the local queue number is closely related to the graph's density and can be arbitrarily far from the classical queue number. We present tools to bound the local queue number of graphs from above and below, focusing on graphs of treewidth $k$. Using these, we show that every graph of treewidth $k$ has local queue number at most $k+1$ and that this bound is tight for $k=2$, while a general lower bound is $\\lceil k/2\\rceil+1$.

{"text": "Title: Balancing Continual Learning and Fine-tuning for Human Activity Recognition\nAbstract: Wearable-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a key task in human-centric machine learning due to its fundamental understanding of human behaviours. Due to the dynamic nature of human behaviours, continual learning promises HAR systems that are tailored to users' needs. However, because of the difficulty in collecting labelled data with wearable sensors, existing approaches that focus on supervised continual learning have limited applicability, while unsupervised continual learning methods only handle representation learning while delaying classifier training to a later stage. This work explores the adoption and adaptation of CaSSLe, a continual self-supervised learning model, and Kaizen, a semi-supervised continual learning model that balances representation learning and down-stream classification, for the task of wearable-based HAR. These schemes re-purpose contrastive learning for knowledge retention and, Kaizen combines that with self-training in a unified scheme that can leverage unlabelled and labelled data for continual learning. In addition to comparing state-of-the-art self-supervised continual learning schemes, we further investigated the importance of different loss terms and explored the trade-off between knowledge retention and learning from new tasks. In particular, our extensive evaluation demonstrated that the use of a weighting factor that reflects the ratio between learned and new classes achieves the best overall trade-off in continual learning.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

In this work we propose a unidirectional post-synaptic potential dependent learning rule that is only triggered by pre-synaptic spikes, and easy to implement on hardware. We demonstrate that such a learning rule is functionally capable of replicating computational capabilities of pairwise STDP. Further more, we demonstrate that this learning rule can be used to learn and classify spatio-temporal spike patterns in an unsupervised manner using individual neurons.

{"text": "Title: Specific Emitter Identification Based on Joint Variational Mode Decomposition\nAbstract: Specific emitter identification (SEI) technology is significant in device administration scenarios, such as self-organized networking and spectrum management, owing to its high security. For nonlinear and non-stationary electromagnetic signals, SEI often employs variational modal decomposition (VMD) to decompose the signal in order to effectively characterize the distinct device fingerprint. However, the trade-off of VMD between the robustness to noise and the ability to preserve signal information has not been investigated in the current literature. Moreover, the existing VMD algorithm does not utilize the stability of the intrinsic distortion of emitters within a certain temporal span, consequently constraining its practical applicability in SEI. In this paper, we propose a joint variational modal decomposition (JVMD) algorithm, which is an improved version of VMD by simultaneously implementing modal decomposition on multi-frame signals. The consistency of multi-frame signals in terms of the central frequencies and the inherent modal functions (IMFs) is exploited, which effectively highlights the distinctive characteristics among emitters and reduces noise. Additionally, the complexity of JVMD is analyzed, which is proven to be more computational-friendly than VMD. Simulations of both modal decomposition and SEI that involve real-world datasets are presented to illustrate that when compared with VMD, the JVMD algorithm improves the accuracy of device classification and the robustness towards noise.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

Similar benefits of perfect delayed CSIT were revealed in recent work by Kobayashi et al., Yang et al., and Gou and Jafar, which extended the above to the case of perfect delayed CSIT and imperfect current CSIT. The work here considers the general problem of communicating, over the aforementioned broadcast channel, with imperfect delayed and imperfect current CSIT, and reveals that even substantially degraded and imperfect delayed-CSIT is in fact sufficient to achieve the aforementioned gains previously associated to perfect delayed CSIT. The work proposes novel multi-phase broadcasting schemes that properly utilize knowledge of imperfect delayed and imperfect current CSIT, to match in many cases the optimal degrees-of-freedom (DoF) region achieved with perfect delayed CSIT.

{"text": "Title: A Hybrid Neural Network Model For Predicting The Nitrate Concentration In The Recirculating Aquaculture System\nAbstract: This study was groundbreaking in its application of neural network models for nitrate management in the Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS). A hybrid neural network model was proposed, which accurately predicted daily nitrate concentration and its trends using six water quality parameters. We conducted a 105-day aquaculture experiment, during which we collected 450 samples from five sets of RAS to train our model (C-L-A model) which incorporates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and self-Attention. Furthermore, we obtained 90 samples from a standalone RAS as the testing data to evaluate the performance of the model in practical applications. The experimental results proved that the C-L-A model accurately predicted nitrate concentration in RAS and maintained good performance even with a reduced proportion of training data. We recommend using water quality parameters from the past 7 days to forecast future nitrate concentration, as this timeframe allows the model to achieve maximum generalization capability. Additionally, we compared the performance of the C-L-A model with three basic neural network models (CNN, LSTM, self-Attention) as well as three hybrid neural network models (CNN-LSTM, CNN-Attention, LSTM-Attention). The results demonstrated that the C-L-A model (R2=0.956) significantly outperformed the other neural network models (R2=0.901-0.927).

{"text": "Title: Efficient Continuous Relaxations for Dense CRF\nAbstract: Dense conditional random fields (CRF) with Gaussian pairwise potentials have emerged as a popular framework for several computer vision applications such as stereo correspondence and semantic segmentation. By modeling long-range interactions, dense CRFs provide a more detailed labelling compared to their sparse counterparts. Variational inference in these dense models is performed using a filtering-based mean-field algorithm in order to obtain a fully-factorized distribution minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence to the true distribution. In contrast to the continuous relaxation-based energy minimisation algorithms used for sparse CRFs, the mean-field algorithm fails to provide strong theoretical guarantees on the quality of its solutions. To address this deficiency, we show that it is possible to use the same filtering approach to speed-up the optimisation of several continuous relaxations. Specifically, we solve a convex quadratic programming (QP) relaxation using the efficient Frank-Wolfe algorithm. This also allows us to solve difference-of-convex relaxations via the iterative concave-convex procedure where each iteration requires solving a convex QP. Finally, we develop a novel divide-and-conquer method to compute the subgradients of a linear programming relaxation that provides the best theoretical bounds for energy minimisation. We demonstrate the advantage of continuous relaxations over the widely used mean-field algorithm on publicly available datasets.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Characterizing Boundedness in Chase Variants\nAbstract: Existential rules are a positive fragment of first-order logic that generalizes function-free Horn rules by allowing existentially quantified variables in rule heads. This family of languages has recently attracted significant interest in the context of ontology-mediated query answering. Forward chaining, also known as the chase, is a fundamental tool for computing universal models of knowledge bases, which consist of existential rules and facts. Several chase variants have been defined, which differ on the way they handle redundancies. A set of existential rules is bounded if it ensures the existence of a bound on the depth of the chase, independently from any set of facts. Deciding if a set of rules is bounded is an undecidable problem for all chase variants. Nevertheless, when computing universal models, knowing that a set of rules is bounded for some chase variant does not help much in practice if the bound remains unknown or even very large. Hence, we investigate the decidability of the k-boundedness problem, which asks whether the depth of the chase for a given set of rules is bounded by an integer k. We identify a general property which, when satisfied by a chase variant, leads to the decidability of k-boundedness. We then show that the main chase variants satisfy this property, namely the oblivious, semi-oblivious (aka Skolem), and restricted chase, as well as their breadth-first versions.

{"text": "Title: Continuous Credit Networks and Layer 2 Blockchains: Monotonicity and Sampling\nAbstract: To improve transaction rates, many cryptocurrencies have implemented so-called ''Layer-2'' transaction protocols, where payments are routed across networks of private payment channels. However, for a given transaction, not every network state provides a feasible route to perform the payment; in this case, the transaction must be put on the public ledger. The payment channel network thus multiplies the transaction rate of the overall system; the less frequently it fails, the higher the multiplier. We build on earlier work on credit networks and show that this network liquidity problem is connected to the combinatorics of graphical matroids. Earlier work could only analyze the (unnatural) scenario where transactions had discrete sizes. Superficially, it might seem like the continuous case would be harder to examine. However, removing this assumption lets us make progress in two important directions. First, we give a partial answer to the ``monotonicity conjecture'' that previous work left open. This conjecture asks that the network's performance not degrade as capacity on any edge increases. And second, we construct here a network state sampling procedure with much faster asymptotic performance than off-the-shelf Markov chains ($O(\\vert E\\vert \\beta(\\vert E\\vert))$, where $\\beta(x)$ is the complexity of solving a linear program on $x$ constraints.) We obtain our results by mapping the underlying graphs to convex bodies and then showing that the liquidity and sampling problems reduce to bounding and computing the volumes of these bodies.

{"text": "Title: Harvesting of interacting stochastic populations\nAbstract: We analyze the optimal harvesting problem for an ecosystem of species that experience environmental stochasticity. Our work generalizes the current literature significantly by taking into account non-linear interactions between species, state-dependent prices, and species injections. The key generalization is making it possible to not only harvest, but also `seed' individuals into the ecosystem. This is motivated by how fisheries and certain endangered species are controlled. The harvesting problem becomes finding the optimal harvesting-seeding strategy that maximizes the expected total income from the harvest minus the lost income from the species injections. Our analysis shows that new phenomena emerge due to the possibility of species injections. It is well-known that multidimensional harvesting problems are very hard to tackle. We are able to make progress, by characterizing the value function as a viscosity solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. Moreover, we provide a verification theorem, which tells us that if a function has certain properties, then it will be the value function. This allows us to show heuristically, as was shown in Lungu and $\\O$ksendal (Bernoulli '01), that it is almost surely never optimal to harvest or seed from more than one population at a time. We approximate the continuous-time systems by Markov chains and show that the optimal harvesting-seeding strategies of the Markov chain approximations converge to the correct optimal harvesting strategy. This is used to provide numerical approximations to the optimal harvesting-seeding strategies and is a first step towards a full understanding of the intricacies of how one should harvest and seed interacting species. In particular, we look at three examples: one species modeled by a Verhulst-Pearl diffusion, two competing species and a two-species predator-prey system.", "field": "math", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Improving Deep Pancreas Segmentation in CT and MRI Images via Recurrent Neural Contextual Learning and Direct Loss Function\nAbstract: Deep neural networks have demonstrated very promising performance on accurate segmentation of challenging organs (e.g., pancreas) in abdominal CT and MRI scans. The current deep learning approaches conduct pancreas segmentation by processing sequences of 2D image slices independently through deep, dense per-pixel masking for each image, without explicitly enforcing spatial consistency constraint on segmentation of successive slices. We propose a new convolutional/recurrent neural network architecture to address the contextual learning and segmentation consistency problem. A deep convolutional sub-network is first designed and pre-trained from scratch. The output layer of this network module is then connected to recurrent layers and can be fine-tuned for contextual learning, in an end-to-end manner. Our recurrent sub-network is a type of Long short-term memory (LSTM) network that performs segmentation on an image by integrating its neighboring slice segmentation predictions, in the form of a dependent sequence processing. Additionally, a novel segmentation-direct loss function (named Jaccard Loss) is proposed and deep networks are trained to optimize Jaccard Index (JI) directly. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate our proposed deep models, on quantitative pancreas segmentation using both CT and MRI scans. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art work on CT [11] and MRI pancreas segmentation [1], respectively.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Neural Ensemble Search via Bayesian Sampling\nAbstract: Recently, neural architecture search (NAS) has been applied to automate the design of neural networks in real-world applications. A large number of algorithms have been developed to improve the search cost or the performance of the final selected architectures in NAS. Unfortunately, these NAS algorithms aim to select only one single well-performing architecture from their search spaces and thus have overlooked the capability of neural network ensemble (i.e., an ensemble of neural networks with diverse architectures) in achieving improved performance over a single final selected architecture. To this end, we introduce a novel neural ensemble search algorithm, called neural ensemble search via Bayesian sampling (NESBS), to effectively and efficiently select well-performing neural network ensembles from a NAS search space. In our extensive experiments, NESBS algorithm is shown to be able to achieve improved performance over state-of-the-art NAS algorithms while incurring a comparable search cost, thus indicating the superior performance of our NESBS algorithm over these NAS algorithms in practice.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

In this paper, we present a novel application of Markov chains to model sequential usage patterns that can be found in the change-logs of collaborative ontology-engineering projects. We provide a detailed presentation of the analysis process, describing all the required steps that are necessary to apply and determine the best fitting Markov chain model.

We are specifically interested in determining the appropriate Markov chain orders which postulate on how many previous actions future ones depend on. To demonstrate the practical usefulness of the extracted Markov chains we conduct sequential pattern analyses on a large-scale collaborative ontology-engineering dataset, the International Classification of Diseases in its 11th revision.

{"text": "Title: U-Mixer: An Unet-Mixer Architecture with Stationarity Correction for Time Series Forecasting\nAbstract: Time series forecasting is a crucial task in various domains. Caused by factors such as trends, seasonality, or irregular fluctuations, time series often exhibits non-stationary. It obstructs stable feature propagation through deep layers, disrupts feature distributions, and complicates learning data distribution changes. As a result, many existing models struggle to capture the underlying patterns, leading to degraded forecasting performance. In this study, we tackle the challenge of non-stationarity in time series forecasting with our proposed framework called U-Mixer. By combining Unet and Mixer, U-Mixer effectively captures local temporal dependencies between different patches and channels separately to avoid the influence of distribution variations among channels, and merge low- and high-levels features to obtain comprehensive data representations. The key contribution is a novel stationarity correction method, explicitly restoring data distribution by constraining the difference in stationarity between the data before and after model processing to restore the non-stationarity information, while ensuring the temporal dependencies are preserved. Through extensive experiments on various real-world time series datasets, U-Mixer demonstrates its effectiveness and robustness, and achieves 14.5\\% and 7.7\\% improvements over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Hot Streaks on Social Media\nAbstract: Measuring the impact and success of human performance is common in various disciplines, including art, science, and sports. Quantifying impact also plays a key role on social media, where impact is usually defined as the reach of a user's content as captured by metrics such as the number of views, likes, retweets, or shares. In this paper, we study entire careers of Twitter users to understand properties of impact. We show that user impact tends to have certain characteristics: First, impact is clustered in time, such that the most impactful tweets of a user appear close to each other. Second, users commonly have 'hot streaks' of impact, i.e., extended periods of high-impact tweets. Third, impact tends to gradually build up before, and fall off after, a user's most impactful tweet. We attempt to explain these characteristics using various properties measured on social media, including the user's network, content, activity, and experience, and find that changes in impact are associated with significant changes in these properties. Our findings open interesting avenues for future research on virality and influence on social media.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Density estimation using the perceptron\nAbstract: We propose a new density estimation algorithm. Given $n$ i.i.d. samples from a distribution belonging to a class of densities on $\\mathbb{R}^d$, our estimator outputs any density in the class whose ''perceptron discrepancy'' with the empirical distribution is at most $O(\\sqrt{d/n})$. The perceptron discrepancy between two distributions is defined as the largest difference in mass that they place on any halfspace of $\\mathbb{R}^d$. It is shown that this estimator achieves expected total variation distance to the truth that is almost minimax optimal over the class of densities with bounded Sobolev norm and Gaussian mixtures. This suggests that regularity of the prior distribution could be an explanation for the efficiency of the ubiquitous step in machine learning that replaces optimization over large function spaces with simpler parametric classes (e.g. in the discriminators of GANs). We generalize the above to show that replacing the ''perceptron discrepancy'' with the generalized energy distance of Sz\\'ekeley-Rizzo further improves total variation loss. The generalized energy distance between empirical distributions is easily computable and differentiable, thus making it especially useful for fitting generative models. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first example of a distance with such properties for which there are minimax statistical guarantees.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

However, there has been little work on evaluating the performance and scalability of these databases in hybrid clouds, where the distance between private and public cloud datacenters can be one of the key factors that can affect their performance. Hence, in this paper, we present a detailed evaluation of throughput, scalability, and VMs size vs. VMs number for six modern databases in a hybrid cloud, consisting of a private cloud in Adelaide and Azure based datacenter in Sydney, Mumbai, and Virginia regions. Based on results, as the distance between private and public clouds increases, the throughput performance of most databases reduces. Second, MongoDB obtains the best throughput performance, followed by MySQL C luster, whilst Cassandra exposes the most fluctuation in through performance.

After proving a general upper bound, we consider some specific classes of experts from Lipschitz class to bounded Hessian class and derive matching lower and upper bounds with provably optimal constants. Our bounds work for a wide range of values of the data dimension and the number of rounds. To derive lower bounds, we use tools from information theory (e.g., Shtarkov sum) and for upper bounds, we resort to new \"smooth truncated covering\" of the class of experts.

System W is a recently introduced inference system for nonmonotonic reasoning that captures and properly extends system Z as well as c-inference.

{"text": "Title: On the use of the M-quantiles for outlier detection in multivariate data\nAbstract: Defining a successful notion of a multivariate quantile has been an open problem for more than half a century, motivating a plethora of possible solutions. Of these, the approach of [8] and [25] leading to M-quantiles, is very appealing for its mathematical elegance combining elements of convex analysis and probability theory. The key idea is the description of a convex function (the K-function) whose gradient (the K-transform) is in one-to-one correspondence between all of R^d and the unit ball in R^d. By analogy with the d=1 case where the K-transform is a cumulative distribution function-like object (an M-distribution), the fact that its inverse is guaranteed to exist lends itself naturally to providing the basis for the definition of a quantile function for all d>=1. Over the past twenty years the resulting M-quantiles have seen applications in a variety of fields, primarily for the purpose of detecting outliers in multidimensional spaces. In this article we prove that for odd d>=3, it is not the gradient but a poly-Laplacian of the K-function that is (almost everywhere) proportional to the density function. For d even one cannot establish a differential equation connecting the K-function with the density. These results show that usage of the K-transform for outlier detection in higher odd-dimensions is in principle flawed, as the K-transform does not originate from inversion of a true M-distribution. We demonstrate these conclusions in two dimensions through examples from non-standard asymmetric distributions. Our examples illustrate a feature of the K-transform whereby regions in the domain with higher density map to larger volumes in the co-domain, thereby producing a magnification effect that moves inliers closer to the boundary of the co-domain than outliers. This feature obviously disrupts any outlier detection mechanism that relies on the inverse K-transform.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

To compensate for such drawbacks, there are many types of research combining classical numerical schemes and machine learning methods by replacing a small portion of the numerical schemes with neural networks.

For this, we construct losses that are motivated by numerical schemes for conservation laws and approximate numerical flux by FNO. Through experiments, we show that our methodology has advantages of both numerical schemes and FNO by comparing with original methods.

{"text": "Title: Mining Temporal Attack Patterns from Cyberthreat Intelligence Reports\nAbstract: Defending from cyberattacks requires practitioners to operate on high-level adversary behavior. Cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports on past cyberattack incidents describe the chain of malicious actions with respect to time. To avoid repeating cyberattack incidents, practitioners must proactively identify and defend against recurring chain of actions - which we refer to as temporal attack patterns. Automatically mining the patterns among actions provides structured and actionable information on the adversary behavior of past cyberattacks. The goal of this paper is to aid security practitioners in prioritizing and proactive defense against cyberattacks by mining temporal attack patterns from cyberthreat intelligence reports. To this end, we propose ChronoCTI, an automated pipeline for mining temporal attack patterns from cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports of past cyberattacks. To construct ChronoCTI, we build the ground truth dataset of temporal attack patterns and apply state-of-the-art large language models, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques. We apply ChronoCTI on a set of 713 CTI reports, where we identify 124 temporal attack patterns - which we categorize into nine pattern categories. We identify that the most prevalent pattern category is to trick victim users into executing malicious code to initiate the attack, followed by bypassing the anti-malware system in the victim network. Based on the observed patterns, we advocate organizations to train users about cybersecurity best practices, introduce immutable operating systems with limited functionalities, and enforce multi-user authentications. Moreover, we advocate practitioners to leverage the automated mining capability of ChronoCTI and design countermeasures against the recurring attack patterns.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

We refer to systems of this form as generalized translation invariant (GTI) systems. Many of the familiar transforms, e.g., the wavelet, shearlet and Gabor transform, both their discrete and continuous variants, are GTI systems. Under a technical $\\alpha$ local integrability condition ($\\alpha$-LIC) we characterize when GTI systems constitute tight and dual frames that yield reproducing formulas for $L^2(G)$. This generalizes results on generalized shift invariant systems, where each $P_j$ is assumed to be countable and each $\\Gamma_j$ is a uniform lattice in $G$, to the case of uncountably many generators and (not necessarily discrete) closed, co-compact subgroups. Furthermore, even in the case of uniform lattices $\\Gamma_j$, our characterizations improve known results since the class of GTI systems satisfying the $\\alpha$-LIC is strictly larger than the class of GTI systems satisfying the previously used local integrability condition.

Accurate interpretation of such prediction outcomes from a machine learning model that explicitly captures temporal correlations can significantly benefit the domain experts. In this context, temporal attention has been successfully applied to isolate the important time steps for the input time series. However, in multivariate time series problems, spatial interpretation is also critical to understand the contributions of different variables on the model outputs. We propose a novel deep learning architecture, called spatiotemporal attention mechanism (STAM) for simultaneous learning of the most important time steps and variables. STAM is a causal (i.e., only depends on past inputs and does not use future inputs) and scalable (i.e., scales well with an increase in the number of variables) approach that is comparable to the state-of-the-art models in terms of computational tractability. We demonstrate our models' performance on two popular public datasets and a domain-specific dataset.

Nevertheless, the 6G design process is at its preliminary stages. The reality today is that hardware, technologies and new materials required to effectively meet the unprecedented performance targets required for future 6G services and network operation, have not been designed, tested or even do not exist yet. Today, a solid vision on the cost-benefit trade-offs of machine learning and artificial intelligence support for 6G network and services operation optimization is missing. This includes the possible support from hardware efficiency, operation effectiveness and, the immeasurable cost due to data acquisition-transfer-processing. The contribution of this paper is three-fold. This is the first paper deriving crucial 6G key performance indicators on hardware and technology design. Second, we present a new hardware technologies design methodology conceived to enable the effective software-hardware components integration required to meet the challenging performance envisioned for future 6G networks.

{"text": "Title: Introducing Packet-Level Analysis in Programmable Data Planes to Advance Network Intrusion Detection\nAbstract: Programmable data planes offer precise control over the low-level processing steps applied to network packets, serving as a valuable tool for analysing malicious flows in the field of intrusion detection. Albeit with limitations on physical resources and capabilities, they allow for the efficient extraction of detailed traffic information, which can then be utilised by Machine Learning (ML) algorithms responsible for identifying security threats. In addressing resource constraints, existing solutions in the literature rely on compressing network data through the collection of statistical traffic features in the data plane. While this compression saves memory resources in switches and minimises the burden on the control channel between the data and the control plane, it also results in a loss of information available to the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), limiting access to packet payload, categorical features, and the semantic understanding of network communications, such as the behaviour of packets within traffic flows. This paper proposes P4DDLe, a framework that exploits the flexibility of P4-based programmable data planes for packet-level feature extraction and pre-processing. P4DDLe leverages the programmable data plane to extract raw packet features from the network traffic, categorical features included, and to organise them in a way that the semantics of traffic flows are preserved. To minimise memory and control channel overheads, P4DDLe selectively processes and filters packet-level data, so that only the features required by the NIDS are collected. The experimental evaluation with recent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack data demonstrates that the proposed approach is very efficient in collecting compact and high-quality representations of network flows, ensuring precise detection of DDoS attacks.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: DHOT-GM: Robust Graph Matching Using A Differentiable Hierarchical Optimal Transport Framework\nAbstract: Graph matching is one of the most significant graph analytic tasks in practice, which aims to find the node correspondence across different graphs. Most existing approaches rely on adjacency matrices or node embeddings when matching graphs, whose performances are often sub-optimal because of not fully leveraging the multi-modal information hidden in graphs, such as node attributes, subgraph structures, etc. In this study, we propose a novel and effective graph matching method based on a differentiable hierarchical optimal transport (HOT) framework, called DHOT-GM. Essentially, our method represents each graph as a set of relational matrices corresponding to the information of different modalities. Given two graphs, we enumerate all relational matrix pairs and obtain their matching results, and accordingly, infer the node correspondence by the weighted averaging of the matching results. This method can be implemented as computing the HOT distance between the two graphs -- each matching result is an optimal transport plan associated with the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance between two relational matrices, and the weights of all matching results are the elements of an upper-level optimal transport plan defined on the matrix sets. We propose a bi-level optimization algorithm to compute the HOT distance in a differentiable way, making the significance of the relational matrices adjustable. Experiments on various graph matching tasks demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

The asymptotic approximation ratio, defined as the ratio of the period of a CH sequence to the lower bound $N^2$ when $N \\to \\infty$, is still 2.5 for the best known CH sequence in the literature. An open question in the multichannel rendezvous problem is whether it is possible to construct a periodic CH sequence that has the asymptotic approximation ratio 1. In this paper, we tighten the theoretical gap by proposing CH sequences, called IDEAL-CH, that have the asymptotic approximation ratio 2.

{"text": "Title: Real-Time 2D Temperature Field Prediction in Metal Additive Manufacturing Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks\nAbstract: Accurately predicting the temperature field in metal additive manufacturing (AM) processes is critical to preventing overheating, adjusting process parameters, and ensuring process stability. While physics-based computational models offer precision, they are often time-consuming and unsuitable for real-time predictions and online control in iterative design scenarios. Conversely, machine learning models rely heavily on high-quality datasets, which can be costly and challenging to obtain within the metal AM domain. Our work addresses this by introducing a physics-informed neural network framework specifically designed for temperature field prediction in metal AM. This framework incorporates a physics-informed input, physics-informed loss function, and a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) architecture. Utilizing real-time temperature data from the process, our model predicts 2D temperature fields for future timestamps across diverse geometries, deposition patterns, and process parameters. We validate the proposed framework in two scenarios: full-field temperature prediction for a thin wall and 2D temperature field prediction for cylinder and cubic parts, demonstrating errors below 3% and 1%, respectively.

{"text": "Title: A macroscopic model for a system of swarming agents using curvature control\nAbstract: In this paper, we study the macroscopic limit of a new model of collective displacement. The model, called PTWA, is a combination of the Vicsek alignment model and the Persistent Turning Walker (PTW) model of motion by curvature control. The PTW model was designed to fit measured trajectories of individual fish. The PTWA model (Persistent Turning Walker with Alignment) describes the displacements of agents which modify their curvature in order to align with their neighbors. The derivation of its macroscopic limit uses the non-classical notion of generalized collisional invariant. The macroscopic limit of the PTWA model involves two physical quantities, the density and the mean velocity of individuals. It is a system of hyperbolic type but is non-conservative due to a geometric constraint on the velocity. This system has the same form as the macroscopic limit of the Vicsek model (the 'Vicsek hydrodynamics') but for the expression of the model coefficients. The numerical computations show that the numerical values of the coefficients are very close. The 'Vicsek Hydrodynamic model' appears in this way as a more generic macroscopic model of swarming behavior as originally anticipated.", "field": "math", "label": 1}

APR tools such as TFix and CodeXGLUE combine text-to-text transformers with software-specific techniques are outperforming alternatives, these days. However, in most APR studies the train and test sets are chosen from the same set of projects. In reality, however, APR models are meant to be generalizable to new and different projects. Therefore, there is a potential threat that reported APR models with high effectiveness perform poorly when the characteristics of the new project or its bugs are different than the training set's(Domain Shift).

{"text": "Title: Learning Knowledge Representation with Meta Knowledge Distillation for Single Image Super-Resolution\nAbstract: Knowledge distillation (KD), which can efficiently transfer knowledge from a cumbersome network (teacher) to a compact network (student), has demonstrated its advantages in some computer vision applications. The representation of knowledge is vital for knowledge transferring and student learning, which is generally defined in hand-crafted manners or uses the intermediate features directly. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic meta knowledge distillation method under the teacher-student architecture for the single image super-resolution task. It provides a more flexible and accurate way to help the teachers transmit knowledge in accordance with the abilities of students via knowledge representation networks (KRNets) with learnable parameters. In order to improve the perception ability of knowledge representation to students' requirements, we propose to solve the transformation process from intermediate outputs to transferred knowledge by employing the student features and the correlation between teacher and student in the KRNets. Specifically, the texture-aware dynamic kernels are generated and then extract texture features to be improved and the corresponding teacher guidance so as to decompose the distillation problem into texture-wise supervision for further promoting the recovery quality of high-frequency details. In addition, the KRNets are optimized in a meta-learning manner to ensure the knowledge transferring and the student learning are beneficial to improving the reconstructed quality of the student.

{"text": "Title: Generating synthetic data for neural operators\nAbstract: Numerous developments in the recent literature show the promising potential of deep learning in obtaining numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) beyond the reach of current numerical solvers. However, data-driven neural operators all suffer from the same problem: the data needed to train a network depends on classical numerical solvers such as finite difference or finite element, among others. In this paper, we propose a new approach to generating synthetic functional training data that does not require solving a PDE numerically. The way we do this is simple: we draw a large number $N$ of independent and identically distributed `random functions' $u_j$ from the underlying solution space (e.g., $H_0^1(\\Omega)$) in which we know the solution lies according to classical theory. We then plug each such random candidate solution into the equation and get a corresponding right-hand side function $f_j$ for the equation, and consider $(f_j, u_j)_{j=1}^N$ as supervised training data for learning the underlying inverse problem $f \\rightarrow u$. This `backwards' approach to generating training data only requires derivative computations, in contrast to standard `forward' approaches, which require a numerical PDE solver, enabling us to generate a large number of such data points quickly and efficiently.

However, there is empirical evidence that a large family of these techniques do not detect OOD reliably in classification tasks. This paper gives a theoretical explanation for said experimental findings and illustrates it on synthetic data. We prove that such techniques are not able to reliably identify OOD samples in a classification setting, since their level of confidence is generalized to unseen areas of the feature space.

Since these initial findings, the study of matroid symmetric powers has remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we establish an equivalence between valuated matroids with arbitrarily large symmetric powers and tropical linear spaces that appear as the variety of a tropical ideal. In establishing this equivalence, we additionally show that all tropical linear spaces are connected through codimension one.

{"text": "Title: Pre-trained Recommender Systems: A Causal Debiasing Perspective\nAbstract: Recent studies on pre-trained vision/language models have demonstrated the practical benefit of a new, promising solution-building paradigm in AI where models can be pre-trained on broad data describing a generic task space and then adapted successfully to solve a wide range of downstream tasks, even when training data is severely limited (e.g., in zero- or few-shot learning scenarios). Inspired by such progress, we investigate in this paper the possibilities and challenges of adapting such a paradigm to the context of recommender systems, which is less investigated from the perspective of pre-trained model. In particular, we propose to develop a generic recommender that captures universal interaction patterns by training on generic user-item interaction data extracted from different domains, which can then be fast adapted to improve few-shot learning performance in unseen new domains (with limited data). However, unlike vision/language data which share strong conformity in the semantic space, universal patterns underlying recommendation data collected across different domains (e.g., different countries or different E-commerce platforms) are often occluded by both in-domain and cross-domain biases implicitly imposed by the cultural differences in their user and item bases, as well as their uses of different e-commerce platforms. As shown in our experiments, such heterogeneous biases in the data tend to hinder the effectiveness of the pre-trained model. To address this challenge, we further introduce and formalize a causal debiasing perspective, which is substantiated via a hierarchical Bayesian deep learning model, named PreRec. Our empirical studies on real-world data show that the proposed model could significantly improve the recommendation performance in zero- and few-shot learning settings under both cross-market and cross-platform scenarios.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

This approach has theoretical and practical implications; the theory applies even if the boundary operator is rank deficient, or near rank deficient. If desired, the pseudoinverse can be implemented directly using standard tools like Matlab. We also introduce a new and simplified version of the semidiscrete approximation of the linear PDE system, which completely avoids taking the time derivative of the boundary data. The stability results are valid for general, nondiagonal summation-by-parts norms. Another key result is the extension of summation-by-parts operators to multi-domains by means of carefully crafted embedding operators. No extra numerical boundary conditions are required at the grid interfaces. The aforementioned pseudoinverse allows for a compact representation of these multi-block operators, which preserves all relevant properties of the single-block operators. The embedding operators can be constructed for multiple space dimensions.

When a classifier is uncertain about the class label for a test instance, it can predict a set of classes instead of a single class. In this paper, we focus on hierarchical multi-class classification problems, where valid sets (typically) correspond to internal nodes of the hierarchy. We argue that this is a very strong restriction, and we propose a relaxation by introducing the notion of representation complexity for a predicted set. In combination with probabilistic classifiers, this leads to a challenging inference problem for which specific combinatorial optimization algorithms are needed. We propose three methods and evaluate them on benchmark datasets: a na\\\"ive approach that is based on matrix-vector multiplication, a reformulation as a knapsack problem with conflict graph, and a recursive tree search method.

{"text": "Title: Real-and-Present: Investigating the Use of Life-Size 2D Video Avatars in HMD-Based AR Teleconferencing\nAbstract: Augmented Reality (AR) teleconferencing allows separately located users to interact with each other in 3D through agents in their own physical environments. Existing methods leveraging volumetric capturing and reconstruction can provide a high-fidelity experience but are often too complex and expensive for everyday usage. Other solutions target mobile and effortless-to-setup teleconferencing on AR Head Mounted Displays (HMD). They directly transplant the conventional video conferencing onto an AR-HMD platform or use avatars to represent remote participants. However, they can only support either a high fidelity or a high level of co-presence. Moreover, the limited Field of View (FoV) of HMDs could further influence users' immersive experience. To achieve a balance between fidelity and co-presence, we explore using life-size 2D video-based avatars (video avatars for short) in AR teleconferencing. Specifically, with the potential effect of FoV on users' perception of proximity, we first conduct a pilot study to explore the local-user-centered optimal placement of video avatars in small-group AR conversations. With the placement results, we then implement a proof-of-concept prototype of video-avatar-based teleconferencing. We conduct user evaluations with the prototype to verify its effectiveness in balancing fidelity and co-presence. Following the indication in the pilot study, we further quantitatively explore the effect of FoV size on the video avatar's optimal placement through a user study involving more FoV conditions in a VR-simulated environment. We regress placement models to serve as references for computationally determining video avatar placements in such teleconferencing applications on various existing AR HMDs and future ones with bigger FoVs.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

Opportunities and Challenges from Task Oriented and Secure Communications to Integrated Sensing\nAbstract: This paper explores opportunities and challenges of task (goal)-oriented and semantic communications for next-generation (NextG) communication networks through the integration of multi-task learning. This approach employs deep neural networks representing a dedicated encoder at the transmitter and multiple task-specific decoders at the receiver, collectively trained to handle diverse tasks including semantic information preservation, source input reconstruction, and integrated sensing and communications. To extend the applicability from point-to-point links to multi-receiver settings, we envision the deployment of decoders at various receivers, where decentralized learning addresses the challenges of communication load and privacy concerns, leveraging federated learning techniques that distribute model updates across decentralized nodes. However, the efficacy of this approach is contingent on the robustness of the employed deep learning models. We scrutinize potential vulnerabilities stemming from adversarial attacks during both training and testing phases. These attacks aim to manipulate both the inputs at the encoder at the transmitter and the signals received over the air on the receiver side, highlighting the importance of fortifying semantic communications against potential multi-domain exploits. Overall, the joint and robust design of task-oriented communications, semantic communications, and integrated sensing and communications in a multi-task learning framework emerges as the key enabler for context-aware, resource-efficient, and secure communications ultimately needed in NextG network systems.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

The most recent symbolic aggregate approximation technique called ABBA demonstrates outstanding performance in preserving essential shape information of time series and enhancing the downstream applications. However, ABBA cannot handle multiple time series with consistent symbols, i.e., the same symbols from distinct time series are not identical. Also, working with appropriate ABBA digitization involves the tedious task of tuning the hyperparameters, such as the number of symbols or tolerance. Therefore, we present a joint symbolic aggregate approximation that has symbolic consistency, and show how the hyperparameter of digitization can itself be optimized alongside the compression tolerance ahead of time. Besides, we propose a novel computing paradigm that enables parallel computing of symbolic approximation.

{"text": "Title: Sharing Non-Anonymous Costs of Multiple Resources Optimally\nAbstract: In cost sharing games, the existence and efficiency of pure Nash equilibria fundamentally depends on the method that is used to share the resources' costs. We consider a general class of resource allocation problems in which a set of resources is used by a heterogeneous set of selfish users. The cost of a resource is a (non-decreasing) function of the set of its users. Under the assumption that the costs of the resources are shared by uniform cost sharing protocols, i.e., protocols that use only local information of the resource's cost structure and its users to determine the cost shares, we exactly quantify the inefficiency of the resulting pure Nash equilibria. Specifically, we show tight bounds on prices of stability and anarchy for games with only submodular and only supermodular cost functions, respectively, and an asymptotically tight bound for games with arbitrary set-functions. While all our upper bounds are attained for the well-known Shapley cost sharing protocol, our lower bounds hold for arbitrary uniform cost sharing protocols and are even valid for games with anonymous costs, i.e., games in which the cost of each resource only depends on the cardinality of the set of its users.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

The widespread occurrence of low-velocity, small-scale, locally isotropic motion (LIMO) typically complicates the identification of appropriate models due to the exaggeration of dynamic effects and sensory perturbation caused by complex friction and phenomena of hysteresis, e.g., pertaining to joint elasticity. We propose a hybrid model learning base architecture combining a rigid body dynamics model identified by parametric regression and time-series neural network architectures based on multilayer-perceptron, LSTM, and Transformer topologies. Further, we introduce novel joint-wise rotational history encoding, reinforcing temporal information to effectively model dynamic hysteresis. The models are evaluated on a KUKA iiwa 14 during algorithmically generated locally isotropic movements. Together with the rotational encoding, the proposed architectures outperform state-of-the-art baselines by a magnitude of 10$^3$ yielding an RMSE of 0.14 Nm.

We put forth a novel procedure for minimizing the amplitude-based least-squares empirical loss, that starts with a weighted maximal correlation initialization obtainable with a few power or Lanczos iterations, followed by successive refinements based upon a sequence of iteratively reweighted (generalized) gradient iterations. The two (both the initialization and gradient flow) stages distinguish themselves from prior contributions by the inclusion of a fresh (re)weighting regularization technique. The overall algorithm is conceptually simple, numerically scalable, and easy-to-implement. For certain random measurement models, the novel procedure is shown capable of finding the true solution $x$ in time proportional to reading the data $\\{(a_i;y_i)\\}_{1\\le i \\le m}$. This holds with high probability and without extra assumption on the signal $x$ to be recovered, provided that the number $m$ of equations is some constant $c>0$ times the number $n$ of unknowns in the signal vector, namely, $m>cn$.

These models are useful for sequences where each event is associated with a single item (a single type of event or a \"mark\") -- but such models are not suited for the practical situation where each event is associated with a set of items. In this work, we develop a general framework for modeling set-valued data in continuous-time, compatible with any intensity-based recurrent neural point process model. In addition, we develop inference methods that can use such models to answer probabilistic queries such as \"the probability of item $A$ being observed before item $B$,\" conditioned on sequence history. Computing exact answers for such queries is generally intractable for neural models due to both the continuous-time nature of the problem setting and the combinatorially-large space of potential outcomes for each event. To address this, we develop a class of importance sampling methods for querying with set-based sequences and demonstrate orders-of-magnitude improvements in efficiency over direct sampling via systematic experiments with four real-world datasets.

{"text": "Title: Large Language Models Relearn Removed Concepts\nAbstract: Advances in model editing through neuron pruning hold promise for removing undesirable concepts from large language models. However, it remains unclear whether models have the capacity to reacquire pruned concepts after editing. To investigate this, we evaluate concept relearning in models by tracking concept saliency and similarity in pruned neurons during retraining. Our findings reveal that models can quickly regain performance post-pruning by relocating advanced concepts to earlier layers and reallocating pruned concepts to primed neurons with similar semantics. This demonstrates that models exhibit polysemantic capacities and can blend old and new concepts in individual neurons.

The model is motivated by multicomponent mixtures where crossdiffusion effects between the different species are taken into account, and where only one species does separate from the others. Using a comparison argument, we obtain strict bounds on the minimizers from which we can derive first-order optimality conditions, revealing a link with the single-species energy, and providing enough regularity to qualify the minimizers as stationary solutions of the evolution system. We also discuss convexity properties of the energy as well as long time asymptotics of the time-dependent problem.

However, current methods often ignore the difference between cell phone RAW images and DSLR camera RGB images, a difference that goes beyond the color matrix and extends to spatial structure due to resolution variations. Recent methods directly rebuild color mapping and spatial structure via shared deep representation, limiting optimal performance. Inspired by Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline, which distinguishes image restoration and enhancement, we present a novel Neural ISP framework, named FourierISP. This approach breaks the image down into style and structure within the frequency domain, allowing for independent optimization. FourierISP is comprised of three subnetworks: Phase Enhance Subnet for structural refinement, Amplitude Refine Subnet for color learning, and Color Adaptation Subnet for blending them in a smooth manner. This approach sharpens both color and structure, and extensive evaluations across varied datasets confirm that our approach realizes state-of-the-art results.

This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for expressive facial animation generation from speech that can exhibit wide-spectrum facial expressions with controllable emotion type and intensity. We propose an emotion controller module to learn the relationship between the emotion variations (e.g., types and intensity) and the corresponding facial expression parameters.

{"text": "Title: The Slepian model based independent interval approximation of persistency and zero-level exceedance distributions\nAbstract: In physics and engineering literature, the distribution of the excursion-above-zero time distribution (exceedance distribution) for a stationary Gaussian process has been approximated by a stationary switching process with independently distributed switching times. The approach matched the covariance of the clipped Gaussian process with the one for the stationary switching process and the distribution of the latter was used as the so-called independent interval approximation (IIA). The approach successfully assessed the persistency exponent for many physically important processes but left an unanswered question when such an approach leads to a mathematically meaningful and proper exceedance distribution. Here we address this question by proposing an alternative matching of the expected values of the clipped Slepian process and the corresponding switched process initiated at the origin. The method has allowed resolving the mathematical correctness of the matching method for a large subclass of the Gaussian processes with monotonic covariance, for which we provide a sufficient condition for the validity of the IIA. Within this class, the IIA produces a valid distribution for the excursion time and is represented in an explicit stochastic form that connects directly to the covariance of the underlying Gaussian process. We compare the excursion level distributions as well as the corresponding persistency exponents obtained through the IIA method with numerically computed exact distributions, and the simulated distribution for several important Gaussian models. We also argue that for stationary Gaussian processes with a non-monotonic covariance, the IIA fails and should not be used.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

NFs comprise a sequence of invertible transformations, that turn a complex target distribution into a simple one, by exploiting the change of variables theorem. Neural Autoregressive Flows (NAFs) and Block Neural Autoregressive Flows (B-NAFs) are arguably the most perfomant members of the NF family. However, they suffer scalability issues and training instability due to the constraints imposed on the network structure. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to these challenges by exploiting transformers to define a new class of neural flows called Transformer Neural Autoregressive Flows (T-NAFs). T-NAFs treat each dimension of a random variable as a separate input token, using attention masking to enforce an autoregressive constraint. We take an amortization-inspired approach where the transformer outputs the parameters of an invertible transformation. The experimental results demonstrate that T-NAFs consistently match or outperform NAFs and B-NAFs across multiple datasets from the UCI benchmark. Remarkably, T-NAFs achieve these results using an order of magnitude fewer parameters than previous approaches, without composing multiple flows.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

We remark that, thanks to a suitable representation of the solution to the deterministic SIS model, this perturbation is rigorous and supported by a Wong-Zakai approximation argument that consists in smoothing the singular Gaussian white noise and then taking limit of the solution from the approximated model. We prove that the stochastic version of the classic SIS model obtained this way preserves a crucial feature of the deterministic equation: the reproduction number dictating the two possible asymptotic regimes for the infection, i.e. extinction and persistence, remains unchanged. We then identify the class of perturbing noises for which this property holds and propose simple sufficient conditions for that.

Because NeRF relies on sampling along rays, it is possible to provide general guidance for acceleration. To that end, we propose a general implicit pipeline for composing NeRF objects quickly. Our method enables the casting of dynamic shadows within or between objects using analytical light sources while allowing multiple NeRF objects to be seamlessly placed and rendered together with any arbitrary rigid transformations. Mainly, our work introduces a new surface representation known as Neural Depth Fields (NeDF) that quickly determines the spatial relationship between objects by allowing direct intersection computation between rays and implicit surfaces. It leverages an intersection neural network to query NeRF for acceleration instead of depending on an explicit spatial structure.Our proposed method is the first to enable both the progressive and interactive composition of NeRF objects.

While pruning techniques are widely used to reduce the computational cost of convolutional neural networks, they tend to focus on optimizing the backbone networks where often most computations are. In this work we demonstrate an additional pruning technique, specifically for object detection: anchor pruning. With more efficient backbone networks and a growing trend of deploying object detectors on embedded systems where post-processing steps such as non-maximum suppression can be a bottleneck, the impact of the anchors used in the detection head is becoming increasingly more important. In this work, we show that many anchors in the object detection head can be removed without any loss in accuracy. With additional retraining, anchor pruning can even lead to improved accuracy. Extensive experiments on SSD and MS COCO show that the detection head can be made up to 44% more efficient while simultaneously increasing accuracy. Further experiments on RetinaNet and PASCAL VOC show the general effectiveness of our approach.

We scraped over 6.9M posts from incels.is and categorized a random sample into non-violent, explicitly violent, and implicitly violent content. Two human coders annotated 3,028 posts, which we used to tune and evaluate GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models across different prompts and batch sizes regarding coding reliability. The best-performing GPT-4 model annotated an additional 30,000 posts for further analysis. Our findings indicate an overall increase in violent speech overtime on incels.is, both at the community and individual level, particularly among more engaged users. While directed violent language decreases, non-directed violent language increases, and self-harm content shows a decline, especially after 2.5 years of user activity.

{"text": "Title: Multi-Source Domain Adaptation with Transformer-based Feature Generation for Subject-Independent EEG-based Emotion Recognition\nAbstract: Although deep learning-based algorithms have demonstrated excellent performance in automated emotion recognition via electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, variations across brain signal patterns of individuals can diminish the model's effectiveness when applied across different subjects. While transfer learning techniques have exhibited promising outcomes, they still encounter challenges related to inadequate feature representations and may overlook the fact that source subjects themselves can possess distinct characteristics. In this work, we propose a multi-source domain adaptation approach with a transformer-based feature generator (MSDA-TF) designed to leverage information from multiple sources. The proposed feature generator retains convolutional layers to capture shallow spatial, temporal, and spectral EEG data representations, while self-attention mechanisms extract global dependencies within these features. During the adaptation process, we group the source subjects based on correlation values and aim to align the moments of the target subject with each source as well as within the sources. MSDA-TF is validated on the SEED dataset and is shown to yield promising results.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Bayesian Intrinsic Groupwise Image Registration: Unsupervised Disentanglement of Anatomy and Geometry\nAbstract: This article presents a general Bayesian learning framework for multi-modal groupwise registration on medical images. The method builds on probabilistic modelling of the image generative process, where the underlying common anatomy and geometric variations of the observed images are explicitly disentangled as latent variables. Thus, groupwise registration is achieved through the solution to Bayesian inference. We propose a novel hierarchical variational auto-encoding architecture to realize the inference procedure of the latent variables, where the registration parameters can be calculated in a mathematically interpretable fashion. Remarkably, this new paradigm can learn groupwise registration in an unsupervised closed-loop self-reconstruction process, sparing the burden of designing complex intensity-based similarity measures. The computationally efficient disentangled architecture is also inherently scalable and flexible, allowing for groupwise registration on large-scale image groups with variable sizes. Furthermore, the inferred structural representations from disentanglement learning are capable of capturing the latent anatomy of the observations with visual semantics. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the proposed framework, including four datasets from cardiac, brain and abdominal medical images. The results have demonstrated the superiority of our method over conventional similarity-based approaches in terms of accuracy, efficiency, scalability and interpretability.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Coded Beam Training\nAbstract: In extremely large-scale multiple input multiple output (XL-MIMO) systems for future sixth-generation (6G) communications, codebook-based beam training stands out as a promising technology to acquire channel state information (CSI). Despite their effectiveness, when the pilot overhead is limited, existing beam training methods suffer from significant achievable rate degradation for remote users with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To tackle this challenge, leverging the error-correcting capability of channel codes, we introduce channel coding theory into hierarchical beam training to extend the coverage area. Specifically, we establish the duality between hierarchical beam training and channel coding, and the proposed coded beam training scheme serves as a general framework. Then, we present two specific implementations exemplified by coded beam training methods based on Hamming codes and convolutional codes, during which the beam encoding and decoding processes are refined respectively to better accommodate to the beam training problem. Simulation results have demonstrated that, the proposed coded beam training method can enable reliable beam training performance for remote users with low SNR, while keeping training overhead low.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: InstructTA: Instruction-Tuned Targeted Attack for Large Vision-Language Models\nAbstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated their incredible capability in image understanding and response generation. However, this rich visual interaction also makes LVLMs vulnerable to adversarial examples. In this paper, we formulate a novel and practical gray-box attack scenario that the adversary can only access the visual encoder of the victim LVLM, without the knowledge of its prompts (which are often proprietary for service providers and not publicly available) and its underlying large language model (LLM). This practical setting poses challenges to the cross-prompt and cross-model transferability of targeted adversarial attack, which aims to confuse the LVLM to output a response that is semantically similar to the attacker's chosen target text. To this end, we propose an instruction-tuned targeted attack (dubbed InstructTA) to deliver the targeted adversarial attack on LVLMs with high transferability. Initially, we utilize a public text-to-image generative model to \"reverse\" the target response into a target image, and employ GPT-4 to infer a reasonable instruction $\\boldsymbol{p}^\\prime$ from the target response. We then form a local surrogate model (sharing the same visual encoder with the victim LVLM) to extract instruction-aware features of an adversarial image example and the target image, and minimize the distance between these two features to optimize the adversarial example.

{"text": "Title: Approximating the Shapley Value without Marginal Contributions\nAbstract: The Shapley value, which is arguably the most popular approach for assigning a meaningful contribution value to players in a cooperative game, has recently been used intensively in explainable artificial intelligence. Its meaningfulness is due to axiomatic properties that only the Shapley value satisfies, which, however, comes at the expense of an exact computation growing exponentially with the number of agents. Accordingly, a number of works are devoted to the efficient approximation of the Shapley value, most of them revolve around the notion of an agent's marginal contribution. In this paper, we propose with SVARM and Stratified SVARM two parameter-free and domain-independent approximation algorithms based on a representation of the Shapley value detached from the notion of marginal contribution.

{"text": "Title: Shrinking unit: a Graph Convolution-Based Unit for CNN-like 3D Point Cloud Feature Extractors\nAbstract: 3D point clouds have attracted increasing attention in architecture, engineering, and construction due to their high-quality object representation and efficient acquisition methods. Consequently, many point cloud feature detection methods have been proposed in the literature to automate some workflows, such as their classification or part segmentation. Nevertheless, the performance of point cloud automated systems significantly lags behind their image counterparts. While part of this failure stems from the irregularity, unstructuredness, and disorder of point clouds, which makes the task of point cloud feature detection significantly more challenging than the image one, we argue that a lack of inspiration from the image domain might be the primary cause of such a gap. Indeed, given the overwhelming success of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image feature detection, it seems reasonable to design their point cloud counterparts, but none of the proposed approaches closely resembles them. Specifically, even though many approaches generalise the convolution operation in point clouds, they fail to emulate the CNNs multiple-feature detection and pooling operations. For this reason, we propose a graph convolution-based unit, dubbed Shrinking unit, that can be stacked vertically and horizontally for the design of CNN-like 3D point cloud feature extractors. Given that self, local and global correlations between points in a point cloud convey crucial spatial geometric information, we also leverage them during the feature extraction process.

Yet, the significant memory and computational costs of dense sampling in volume rendering have forced 3D GANs to adopt patch-based training or employ low-resolution rendering with post-processing 2D super resolution, which sacrifices multiview consistency and the quality of resolved geometry. Consequently, 3D GANs have not yet been able to fully resolve the rich 3D geometry present in 2D images. In this work, we propose techniques to scale neural volume rendering to the much higher resolution of native 2D images, thereby resolving fine-grained 3D geometry with unprecedented detail. Our approach employs learning-based samplers for accelerating neural rendering for 3D GAN training using up to 5 times fewer depth samples. This enables us to explicitly \"render every pixel\" of the full-resolution image during training and inference without post-processing superresolution in 2D. Together with our strategy to learn high-quality surface geometry, our method synthesizes high-resolution 3D geometry and strictly view-consistent images while maintaining image quality on par with baselines relying on post-processing super resolution.

In the second step, the posterior samples are transformed to satisfy the structural restriction through a post-processing function. The conceptually straightforward procedure of the post-processed posterior makes its computation efficient and can render interval estimators of functionals of covariance matrices. We show that it has nearly optimal minimax rates for banded covariances among all possible pairs of priors and post-processing functions. Furthermore, we prove that the expected coverage probability of the $(1-\\alpha)100\\%$ highest posterior density region of the post-processed posterior is asymptotically $1-\\alpha$ with respect to a conventional posterior distribution.

{"text": "Title: Predicting Post-Route Quality of Results Estimates for HLS Designs using Machine Learning\nAbstract: Machine learning (ML) has been widely used to improve the predictability of EDA tools. The use of CAD tools that express designs at higher levels of abstraction makes machine learning even more important to highlight the performance of various design steps. Behavioral descriptions used during the high-level synthesis (HLS) are completely technology independent making it hard for designers to interpret how changes in the synthesis options affect the resultant circuit. FPGA design flows are completely embracing HLS based methodologies so that software engineers with almost no hardware design skills can easily use their tools. HLS tools allow design space exploration by modifying synthesis options, however, they lack accuracy in the Quality of Results (QoR) reported right after HLS. This lack of correctness results in sub-optimal designs with problems in timing closure. This paper presents a robust ML based design flow that can accurately predict post-route QoR for a given behavioral description without the need to synthesize the design. The model is an important design exploration tool where a designer can quickly view the impact on overall design quality when local and global optimization directives are changed. The proposed methodology presents two strong advantages: (i) Accurate prediction of the design quality (QoR), and (ii) complete elimination of the need to execute high-level synthesis for each design option. We predict three post route parameters, (i). Area, (ii). Latency and (iii). Clock Period of a design just by analyzing the high level behavioral code and some intermediate representation codes. We have integrated the methodology with Xilinx HLS tools and have demonstrated accurate estimation on a variety of FPGA families. Our estimated results are within 10\\% of actual computed values", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Explicit construction of a plane sextic model for genus-five Howe curves, II\nAbstract: A Howe curve is defined as the normalization of the fiber product over a projective line of two hyperelliptic curves. Howe curves are very useful to produce important classes of curves over fields of positive characteristic, e.g., maximal, superspecial, or supersingular ones. Determining their feasible equations explicitly is a basic problem, and it has been solved in the hyperelliptic case and in the non-hyperelliptic case with genus not greater than $4$. In this paper, we construct an explicit plane sextic model for non-hyperelliptic Howe curves of genus $5$. We also determine the number and type of singularities on our sextic model, and prove that the singularities are generically $4$ double points. Our results together with Moriya-Kudo's recent ones imply that for each $s \\in \\{2,3,4,5\\}$, there exists a non-hyperellptic curve $H$ of genus $5$ with $\\mathrm{Aut}(H) \\supset \\mathbf{V}_4$ such that its associated plane sextic has $s$ double points.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Assessing the Impact of a User-Item Collaborative Attack on Class of Users\nAbstract: Collaborative Filtering (CF) models lie at the core of most recommendation systems due to their state-of-the-art accuracy. They are commonly adopted in e-commerce and online services for their impact on sales volume and/or diversity, and their impact on companies' outcome. However, CF models are only as good as the interaction data they work with. As these models rely on outside sources of information, counterfeit data such as user ratings or reviews can be injected by attackers to manipulate the underlying data and alter the impact of resulting recommendations, thus implementing a so-called shilling attack. While previous works have focused on evaluating shilling attack strategies from a global perspective paying particular attention to the effect of the size of attacks and attacker's knowledge, in this work we explore the effectiveness of shilling attacks under novel aspects. First, we investigate the effect of attack strategies crafted on a target user in order to push the recommendation of a low-ranking item to a higher position, referred to as user-item attack. Second, we evaluate the effectiveness of attacks in altering the impact of different CF models by contemplating the class of the target user, from the perspective of the richness of her profile (i.e., cold v.s. warm user). Finally, similar to previous work we contemplate the size of attack (i.e., the amount of fake profiles injected) in examining their success. The results of experiments on two widely used datasets in business and movie domains, namely Yelp and MovieLens, suggest that warm and cold users exhibit contrasting behaviors in datasets with different characteristics.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

We show that when they intersect non-transversally, the convergence rate is $O(k^{-1/2})$, where $k$ is the number of iterations of the APM. In particular, when the intersection is not at the origin or forms a half-line with the origin as the endpoint, the obtained convergence rate can be exact because a lower bound of the convergence rate is evaluated. These results coincide with the worst-case convergence rate obtained from the error bound discussed in [Borwein et al., SIOPT, 2014] and [Drusvyatskiy et al., Math. Prog., 2017]. Moreover, we consider the convergence rate of the APM for the intersection of an affine subspace and the product of two second-order cones.

Recent works have proposed that these features can be formally identified as those perturbations of the states whose distinguishability most resist coarse-graining. Here, we examine whether this same strategy can be used to identify important features of an unlabeled dataset. This approach indeed results in a technique very similar to kernel PCA (principal component analysis), but with a kernel function that is automatically adapted to the data, or \"learned\". We test this approach on handwritten digits, and find that the most relevant features are significantly better for classification than those obtained from a simple gaussian kernel.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

Let $P_n^t$ denote the $t$-th power of a monotone path on $n$ vertices. The ordered Ramsey numbers of powers of paths have been extensively studied.

{"text": "Title: Variance Reduction is an Antidote to Byzantines: Better Rates, Weaker Assumptions and Communication Compression as a Cherry on the Top\nAbstract: Byzantine-robustness has been gaining a lot of attention due to the growth of the interest in collaborative and federated learning. However, many fruitful directions, such as the usage of variance reduction for achieving robustness and communication compression for reducing communication costs, remain weakly explored in the field. This work addresses this gap and proposes Byz-VR-MARINA - a new Byzantine-tolerant method with variance reduction and compression. A key message of our paper is that variance reduction is key to fighting Byzantine workers more effectively. At the same time, communication compression is a bonus that makes the process more communication efficient. We derive theoretical convergence guarantees for Byz-VR-MARINA outperforming previous state-of-the-art for general non-convex and Polyak-Lojasiewicz loss functions. Unlike the concurrent Byzantine-robust methods with variance reduction and/or compression, our complexity results are tight and do not rely on restrictive assumptions such as boundedness of the gradients or limited compression. Moreover, we provide the first analysis of a Byzantine-tolerant method supporting non-uniform sampling of stochastic gradients.

{"text": "Title: Level-set based design of Wang tiles for modelling complex microstructures\nAbstract: Microstructural geometry plays a critical role in the response of heterogeneous materials. Consequently, methods for generating microstructural samples are increasingly crucial to advanced numerical analyses. We extend Sonon et al.'s unified framework, developed originally for generating particulate and foam-like microstructural geometries of Periodic Unit Cells, to non-periodic microstructural representations based on the formalism of Wang tiles. This formalism has been recently proposed in order to generalize the Periodic Unit Cell approach, enabling a fast synthesis of arbitrarily large, stochastic microstructural samples from a handful of domains with predefined compatibility constraints. However, a robust procedure capable of designing complex, three-dimensional, foam-like and cellular morphologies of Wang tiles has not yet been proposed. This contribution fills the gap by significantly broadening the applicability of the tiling concept. Since the original Sonon et al.'s framework builds on a random sequential addition of particles enhanced with an implicit representation of particle boundaries by the level-set field, we first devise an analysis based on a connectivity graph of a tile set, resolving the question where a particle should be copied when it intersects a tile boundary. Next, we introduce several modifications to the original algorithm that are necessary to ensure microstructural compatibility in the generalized periodicity setting of Wang tiles. Having established a universal procedure for generating tile morphologies, we compare strictly aperiodic and stochastic sets with the same cardinality in terms of reducing the artificial periodicity in reconstructed microstructural samples. We demonstrate the superiority of the vertex-defined tile sets for two-dimensional problems and illustrate the capabilities of the algorithm with two- and three-dimensional examples.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

In this paper, we study a distinct direction on the propagation of model uncertainty and how it impacts the reliability of rare-event estimates. Specifically, we consider the basic setup of the exceedance of i.i.d. sum, and investigate how the lack of tail information of each input summand can affect the output probability. We argue that heavy-tailed problems are much more vulnerable to input uncertainty than light-tailed problems, reasoned through their large deviations behaviors and numerical evidence.

The migrating cells perform nonlinear diffusion and two types of taxis in response to non-diffusing cues: away from proliferating cells and up the gradient of surrounding tissue. Transitions between the two cell subpopulations are influenced by subcellular (receptor binding) dynamics, thus conferring the setting a multiscale character.

However, this advancement presents considerably greater challenges in detecting the authenticity of such content. Existing deepfake detection datasets and methods often fall short in effectively capturing the extensive range of emerging deepfakes and offering satisfactory explanatory information for detection. To address the significant issue, this paper introduces a deepfake database (DFLIP-3K) for the development of convincing and explainable deepfake detection. It encompasses about 300K diverse deepfake samples from approximately 3K generative models, which boasts the largest number of deepfake models in the literature. Moreover, it collects around 190K linguistic footprints of these deepfakes. The two distinguished features enable DFLIP-3K to develop a benchmark that promotes progress in linguistic profiling of deepfakes, which includes three sub-tasks namely deepfake detection, model identification, and prompt prediction. The deepfake model and prompt are two essential components of each deepfake, and thus dissecting them linguistically allows for an invaluable exploration of trustworthy and interpretable evidence in deepfake detection, which we believe is the key for the next-generation deepfake detection. Furthermore, DFLIP-3K is envisioned as an open database that fosters transparency and encourages collaborative efforts to further enhance its growth.

Our goal is to find the optimal placement (configuration) of instances to minimize the average cost over time, leveraging the ability of predicting future cost parameters with known accuracy. We first propose an offline algorithm that solves for the optimal configuration in a specific look-ahead time-window.

We analytically show that the online algorithm is $O(1)$-competitive for a broad family of cost functions.

Coordination is required also for identifying discovered and disclosed software vulnerabilities with Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). Motivated by recent practical challenges, this paper examines the coordination of CVEs for open source projects through a public mailing list. Objective: The paper observes the historical time delays between the assignment of CVEs on a mailing list and the later appearance of these in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Drawing from research on software engineering coordination, software vulnerabilities, and bug tracking, the delays are modeled through three dimensions: social networks and communication practices, tracking infrastructures, and the technical characteristics of the CVEs coordinated. Method: Given a period between 2008 and 2016, a sample of over five thousand CVEs is used to model the delays with nearly fifty explanatory metrics. Regression analysis is used for the modeling. Results: The results show that the CVE coordination delays are affected by different abstractions for noise and prerequisite constraints. These abstractions convey effects from the social network and infrastructure dimensions. Particularly strong effect sizes are observed for annual and monthly control metrics, a control metric for weekends, the degrees of the nodes in the CVE coordination networks, and the number of references given in NVD for the CVEs archived.

{"text": "Title: CURE Dataset: Ladder Networks for Audio Event Classification\nAbstract: Audio event classification is an important task for several applications such as surveillance, audio, video and multimedia retrieval etc. There are approximately 3M people with hearing loss who can't perceive events happening around them. This paper establishes the CURE dataset which contains curated set of specific audio events most relevant for people with hearing loss. We propose a ladder network based audio event classifier that utilizes 5s sound recordings derived from the Freesound project. We adopted the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) embeddings as audio features for this task. We also investigate extreme learning machine (ELM) for event classification. In this study, proposed classifiers are compared with support vector machine (SVM) baseline. We propose signal and feature normalization that aims to reduce the mismatch between different recordings scenarios. Firstly, CNN is trained on weakly labeled Audioset data. Next, the pre-trained model is adopted as feature extractor for proposed CURE corpus. We incorporate ESC-50 dataset as second evaluation set. Results and discussions validate the superiority of Ladder network over ELM and SVM classifier in terms of robustness and increased classification accuracy. While Ladder network is robust to data mismatches, simpler SVM and ELM classifiers are sensitive to such mismatches, where the proposed normalization techniques can play an important role. Experimental studies with ESC-50 and CURE corpora elucidate the differences in dataset complexity and robustness offered by proposed approaches.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

We prove that it is the same as $n(H,g)$ up to a multiplicative constant. ii) The smallest size girth $g$ graph with a prescribed degree distribution.

In these cases, classical models that provide good approximations to systems with infinitely long codewords become imprecise. To remedy this, in this paper, an average coding rate expression is derived for a large scale network with short codewords using stochastic geometry and the theory of coding in the finite blocklength regime. The average coding rate and upper and lower bounds on the outage probability of the large-scale network are derived, and a tight approximation of the outage probability is presented. Then, simulations are presented to study the effect of network parameters on the average coding rate and the outage probability of the network, which demonstrate that results in the literature derived for the infinite blocklength regime overestimate the network performance, whereas the results in this paper provide a more realistic performance evaluation.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Sphere-like isoparametric hypersurfaces in Damek-Ricci spaces\nAbstract: Locally harmonic manifolds are Riemannian manifolds in which small geodesic spheres are isoparametric hypersurfaces, i.e., hypersurfaces whose nearby parallel hypersurfaces are of constant mean curvature. Flat and rank one symmetric spaces are examples of harmonic manifolds. Damek-Ricci spaces are non-compact harmonic manifolds, most of which are non-symmetric. Taking the limit of an \"inflating\" sphere through a point $p$ in a Damek-Ricci space as the center of the sphere runs out to infinity along a geodesic half-line $\\gamma$ starting from $p$, we get a horosphere. Similarly to spheres, horospheres are also isoparametric hypersurfaces.

Outdoor air pollution is a major environmental health problem affecting low, middle, and high-income countries. In the past few years, the research community has explored IoT-enabled machine learning applications for outdoor air pollution prediction. The general objective of this paper is to systematically review applications of machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT) for outdoor air pollution prediction and the combination of monitoring sensors and input features used. Two research questions were formulated for this review. 1086 publications were collected in the initial PRISMA stage. After the screening and eligibility phases, 37 papers were selected for inclusion. A cost-based analysis was conducted on the findings to highlight high-cost monitoring, low-cost IoT and hybrid enabled prediction. Three methods of prediction were identified: time series, feature-based and spatio-temporal. This review's findings identify major limitations in applications found in the literature, namely lack of coverage, lack of diversity of data and lack of inclusion of context-specific features.

{"text": "Title: On friendship and cyclic parking functions\nAbstract: In parking problems, a given number of cars enter a one-way street sequentially, and try to park according to a specified preferred spot in the street. Various models are possible depending on the chosen rule for collisions, when two cars have the same preferred spot. In classical parking functions, if a car's preferred spot is already occupied by a previous car, it drives forward and looks for the first unoccupied spot to park. In this work, we introduce a variant of classical parking functions, called \"friendship parking functions\", which imposes additional restrictions on where cars can park. Namely, a car can only end up parking next to cars which are its friends (friendship will correspond to adjacency in an underlying graph). We characterise and enumerate such friendship parking functions according to their outcome permutation, which describes the final configuration when all cars have parked. We apply this to the case where the underlying friendship graph is the cycle graph. Finally, we consider a subset of classical parking functions, called \"cyclic parking functions\", where cars end up in an increasing cyclic order. We enumerate these cyclic parking functions and exhibit a bijection to permutation components.", "field": "math", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Towards Unsupervised Open World Semantic Segmentation\nAbstract: For the semantic segmentation of images, state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve high segmentation accuracy if that task is restricted to a closed set of classes. However, as of now DNNs have limited ability to operate in an open world, where they are tasked to identify pixels belonging to unknown objects and eventually to learn novel classes, incrementally. Humans have the capability to say: I don't know what that is, but I've already seen something like that. Therefore, it is desirable to perform such an incremental learning task in an unsupervised fashion. We introduce a method where unknown objects are clustered based on visual similarity. Those clusters are utilized to define new classes and serve as training data for unsupervised incremental learning. More precisely, the connected components of a predicted semantic segmentation are assessed by a segmentation quality estimate. connected components with a low estimated prediction quality are candidates for a subsequent clustering. Additionally, the component-wise quality assessment allows for obtaining predicted segmentation masks for the image regions potentially containing unknown objects. The respective pixels of such masks are pseudo-labeled and afterwards used for re-training the DNN, i.e., without the use of ground truth generated by humans. In our experiments we demonstrate that, without access to ground truth and even with few data, a DNN's class space can be extended by a novel class, achieving considerable segmentation accuracy.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

Yet, little is known about how residual connections in RNNs influence their dynamics and fading memory properties. Here, we introduce weakly coupled residual recurrent networks (WCRNNs) in which residual connections result in well-defined Lyapunov exponents and allow for studying properties of fading memory. We investigate how the residual connections of WCRNNs influence their performance, network dynamics, and memory properties on a set of benchmark tasks. We show that several distinct forms of residual connections yield effective inductive biases that result in increased network expressivity. In particular, those are residual connections that (i) result in network dynamics at the proximity of the edge of chaos, (ii) allow networks to capitalize on characteristic spectral properties of the data, and (iii) result in heterogeneous memory properties. In addition, we demonstrate how our results can be extended to non-linear residuals and introduce a weakly coupled residual initialization scheme that can be used for Elman RNNs.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

We show the necessary conditions any optimal solution must satisfy and present a solution for systems of three robots.

The main effect of diffuse flux in the absence of collimated flux is on the swimming behaviour of microorganisms in the suspension. At higher diffuse flux, the horizontal component of swimming orientation exhibits a higher magnitude, which slows the rate of pattern formation in the suspension. Also, the linear stability of the suspension predicts that the most unstable mode of disturbance transits from stationary (oscillatory) to oscillatory (stationary) at the variation in the magnitude of diffuse flux for some fixed parameters. The overstable nature of disturbance is mostly observed at the high value of swimming speed and extinction coefficient. Moreover, the suspension shows a more stable behaviour at the higher magnitude of diffuse flux.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

We define a new metric that helps us identify which data points specifically do algorithms seeking flatter optima do better when compared to vanilla SGD. We find that the generalization gains achieved by Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) are particularly pronounced for atypical data points, which necessitate memorization.

{"text": "Title: The singular limit of the Water-Waves equations in the rigid lid regime\nAbstract: The re-scaled Water-Waves equations depend strongly on the ratio epsilon between the amplitude of the wave and the depth of the water. We investigate in this paper the convergence as epsilon goes to zero of the free surface Euler equations to the so called rigid lid model. We first prove that the only solutions of this model are zero. Due to the conservation of the Hamiltonian, the solutions of the free surface Euler equations converge weakly to zero, but not strongly in the general case, as epsilon goes to zero. We then study this default of convergence. More precisely, we show a strong convergence result of the solutions of the water waves equations in the Zakharov-Craig-Sulem formulation to the solutions of the linear water-waves equations. It is then easy to observe that these latter converge weakly to zero. The simple structure of this system also allows us to explain the mechanisms of the weak convergence to zero. Finally, we show that this convergence to the rigid lid model also holds for the solutions of the Euler equations. To this end we give a new proof of the equivalence of the free surface Euler equations and of the Zakharov-Craig-Sulem equation by building an extension of the velocity and pressure fields.", "field": "math", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Quota Trees\nAbstract: We introduce the notion of quota trees in directed graphs. Given a nonnegative integer ``quota'' for each vertex of a directed multigraph $G$, a quota tree is an immersed rooted tree which hits each vertex of $G$ the prescribed number of times. When the quotas are all one, the tree is actually embedded and we recover the usual notion of a spanning arborescence (directed spanning tree). The usual algorithms which produce spanning arborescences with various properties typically have (sometimes more complicated) ``quota'' analogues. Our original motivation for studying quota trees was the problem of characterizing the sizes of the Myhill-Nerode equivalence classes in a connected deterministic finite-state automaton recognizing a given regular language. We show that the obstruction to realizing a given set of M-N class sizes is precisely the existence of a suitable quota tree. In this paper we develop the basic theory of quota trees. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a quota tree (or forest) over a given directed graph with specified quotas, solving the M-N class size problem as a special case. We discuss some potential applications of quota trees and forests, and connect them to the $k$ lightest paths problem. We give two proofs of the main theorem: one based on an algorithmic loop invariant, and one based on direct enumeration of quota trees. For the latter, we use Lagrange inversion to derive a formula which vastly generalizes both the matrix-tree theorem and Cayley's formula for counting labeled trees. We give an efficient algorithm to sample uniformly from the set of forests with given quotas, as well as a generalization of Edmonds' algorithm for computing a minimum-weight quota forest.", "field": "math", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Method for Solving State-Path Constrained Optimal Control Problems Using Adaptive Radau Collocation\nAbstract: A new method is developed for accurately approximating the solution to state-variable inequality path constrained optimal control problems using a multiple-domain adaptive Legendre-Gauss-Radau collocation method. The method consists of the following parts. First, a structure detection method is developed to estimate switch times in the activation and deactivation of state-variable inequality path constraints. Second, using the detected structure, the domain is partitioned into multiple-domains where each domain corresponds to either a constrained or an unconstrained segment. Furthermore, additional decision variables are introduced in the multiple-domain formulation, where these additional decision variables represent the switch times of the detected active state-variable inequality path constraints. Within a constrained domain, the path constraint is differentiated with respect to the independent variable until the control appears explicitly, and this derivative is set to zero along the constrained arc while all preceding derivatives are set to zero at the start of the constrained arc. The time derivatives of the active state-variable inequality path constraints are computed using automatic differentiation and the properties of the chain rule. The method is demonstrated on two problems, the first being a benchmark optimal control problem which has a known analytical solution and the second being a challenging problem from the field of aerospace engineering in which there is no known analytical solution. When compared against previously developed adaptive Legendre-Gauss-Radau methods, the results show that the method developed in this paper is capable of computing accurate solutions to problems whose solution contain active state-variable inequality path constraints.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: From Language to Programs: Bridging Reinforcement Learning and Maximum Marginal Likelihood\nAbstract: Our goal is to learn a semantic parser that maps natural language utterances into executable programs when only indirect supervision is available: examples are labeled with the correct execution result, but not the program itself. Consequently, we must search the space of programs for those that output the correct result, while not being misled by spurious programs: incorrect programs that coincidentally output the correct result. We connect two common learning paradigms, reinforcement learning (RL) and maximum marginal likelihood (MML), and then present a new learning algorithm that combines the strengths of both. The new algorithm guards against spurious programs by combining the systematic search traditionally employed in MML with the randomized exploration of RL, and by updating parameters such that probability is spread more evenly across consistent programs. We apply our learning algorithm to a new neural semantic parser and show significant gains over existing state-of-the-art results on a recent context-dependent semantic parsing task.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Pixel personality for dense object tracking in a 2D honeybee hive\nAbstract: Tracking large numbers of densely-arranged, interacting objects is challenging due to occlusions and the resulting complexity of possible trajectory combinations, as well as the sparsity of relevant, labeled datasets. Here we describe a novel technique of collective tracking in the model environment of a 2D honeybee hive in which sample colonies consist of $N\\sim10^3$ highly similar individuals, tightly packed, and in rapid, irregular motion. Such a system offers universal challenges for multi-object tracking, while being conveniently accessible for image recording. We first apply an accurate, segmentation-based object detection method to build initial short trajectory segments by matching object configurations based on class, position and orientation. We then join these tracks into full single object trajectories by creating an object recognition model which is adaptively trained to recognize honeybee individuals through their visual appearance across multiple frames, an attribute we denote as pixel personality. Overall, we reconstruct ~46% of the trajectories in 5 min recordings from two different hives and over 71% of the tracks for at least 2 min. We provide validated trajectories spanning 3000 video frames of 876 unmarked moving bees in two distinct colonies in different locations and filmed with different pixel resolutions, which we expect to be useful in the further development of general-purpose tracking solutions.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: UpFusion: Novel View Diffusion from Unposed Sparse View Observations\nAbstract: We propose UpFusion, a system that can perform novel view synthesis and infer 3D representations for an object given a sparse set of reference images without corresponding pose information. Current sparse-view 3D inference methods typically rely on camera poses to geometrically aggregate information from input views, but are not robust in-the-wild when such information is unavailable/inaccurate. In contrast, UpFusion sidesteps this requirement by learning to implicitly leverage the available images as context in a conditional generative model for synthesizing novel views. We incorporate two complementary forms of conditioning into diffusion models for leveraging the input views: a) via inferring query-view aligned features using a scene-level transformer, b) via intermediate attentional layers that can directly observe the input image tokens. We show that this mechanism allows generating high-fidelity novel views while improving the synthesis quality given additional (unposed) images. We evaluate our approach on the Co3Dv2 and Google Scanned Objects datasets and demonstrate the benefits of our method over pose-reliant sparse-view methods as well as single-view methods that cannot leverage additional views. Finally, we also show that our learned model can generalize beyond the training categories and even allow reconstruction from self-captured images of generic objects in-the-wild.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Learned Image Downscaling for Upscaling using Content Adaptive Resampler\nAbstract: Deep convolutional neural network based image super-resolution (SR) models have shown superior performance in recovering the underlying high resolution (HR) images from low resolution (LR) images obtained from the predefined downscaling methods. In this paper we propose a learned image downscaling method based on content adaptive resampler (CAR) with consideration on the upscaling process. The proposed resampler network generates content adaptive image resampling kernels that are applied to the original HR input to generate pixels on the downscaled image. Moreover, a differentiable upscaling (SR) module is employed to upscale the LR result into its underlying HR counterpart. By back-propagating the reconstruction error down to the original HR input across the entire framework to adjust model parameters, the proposed framework achieves a new state-of-the-art SR performance through upscaling guided image resamplers which adaptively preserve detailed information that is essential to the upscaling. Experimental results indicate that the quality of the generated LR image is comparable to that of the traditional interpolation based method, but the significant SR performance gain is achieved by deep SR models trained jointly with the CAR model.

{"text": "Title: Spiking NeRF: Representing the Real-World Geometry by a Discontinuous Representation\nAbstract: A crucial reason for the success of existing NeRF-based methods is to build a neural density field for the geometry representation via multiple perceptron layers (MLPs). MLPs are continuous functions, however, real geometry or density field is frequently discontinuous at the interface between the air and the surface. Such a contrary brings the problem of unfaithful geometry representation. To this end, this paper proposes spiking NeRF, which leverages spiking neurons and a hybrid Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-Spiking Neural Network (SNN) framework to build a discontinuous density field for faithful geometry representation. Specifically, we first demonstrate the reason why continuous density fields will bring inaccuracy. Then, we propose to use the spiking neurons to build a discontinuous density field. We conduct a comprehensive analysis for the problem of existing spiking neuron models and then provide the numerical relationship between the parameter of the spiking neuron and the theoretical accuracy of geometry. Based on this, we propose a bounded spiking neuron to build the discontinuous density field. Our method achieves SOTA performance.

{"text": "Title: Capacity Bounds and User Identification Costs in Rayleigh-Fading Many-Access Channel\nAbstract: Many-access channel (MnAC) model allows the number of users in the system and the number of active users to scale as a function of the blocklength and as such is suited for dynamic communication systems with massive number of users such as the Internet of Things. Existing MnAC models assume a priori knowledge of channel gains which is impractical since acquiring Channel State Information (CSI) for massive number of users can overwhelm the available radio resources. This paper incorporates Rayleigh fading effects to the MnAC model and derives an upper bound on the symmetric message-length capacity of the Rayleigh-fading Gaussian MnAC. Furthermore, a lower bound on the minimum number of channel uses for discovering the active users is established. In addition, the performance of Noisy Combinatorial Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (N-COMP) based group testing (GT) is studied as a practical strategy for active device discovery. Simulations show that, for a given SNR, as the number of users increase, the required number of channel uses for N-COMP GT scales approximately the same way as the lower bound on minimum user identification cost. Moreover, in the low SNR regime, for sufficiently large population sizes, the number of channel uses required by N-COMP GT was observed to be within a factor of two of the lower bound when the expected number of active users scales sub-linearly with the total population size.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

Aim at this issue, this paper proposes a sampling method for unknown networks at low sampling rates, called SLSR, which first adopts a random node sampling to evaluate a degree threshold, utilized to distinguish the core from periphery, and the average degree in unknown networks, and then runs a double-layer sampling strategy on the core and periphery. SLSR is simple that results in a high time efficiency, but experimental evaluation confirms that the proposed method can accurately preserve many critical structures of unknown large networks with low sampling rates and low variances.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Consistent estimation of non-bandlimited spectral density from uniformly spaced samples\nAbstract: In the matter of selection of sample time points for the estimation of the power spectral density of a continuous time stationary stochastic process, irregular sampling schemes such as Poisson sampling are often preferred over regular (uniform) sampling. A major reason for this preference is the well-known problem of inconsistency of estimators based on regular sampling, when the underlying power spectral density is not bandlimited. It is argued in this paper that, in consideration of a large sample property like consistency, it is natural to allow the sampling rate to go to infinity as the sample size goes to infinity. Through appropriate asymptotic calculations under this scenario, it is shown that the smoothed periodogram based on regularly spaced data is a consistent estimator of the spectral density, even when the latter is not band-limited. It transpires that, under similar assumptions, the estimators based on uniformly sampled and Poisson-sampled data have about the same rate of convergence. Apart from providing this reassuring message, the paper also gives a guideline for practitioners regarding appropriate choice of the sampling rate. Theoretical calculations for large samples and Monte-Carlo simulations for small samples indicate that the smoothed periodogram based on uniformly sampled data have less variance and more bias than its counterpart based on Poisson sampled data.", "field": "math", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Parameterized Verification of Disjunctive Timed Networks\nAbstract: We introduce new techniques for the parameterized verification of disjunctive timed networks (DTNs), i.e., networks of timed automata (TAs) that communicate via location guards that enable a transition only if there is another process in a given location. This computational model has been considered in the literature before, example applications are gossiping clock synchronization protocols or planning problems. We address the minimum-time reachability problem (Minreach) in DTNs, and show how to efficiently solve it based on a novel zone graph algorithm. We further show that solving Minreach allows us to construct a summary TA capturing exactly the possible behaviors of a single TA within a DTN of arbitrary size. The combination of these two results enables the parameterized verification of DTNs, while avoiding the construction of an exponential-size cutoff system required by existing results. Additionally, we develop sufficient conditions for solving Minreach and parameterized verification problems even in certain cases where locations that appear in location guards can have clock invariants, a case that has usually been excluded in the literature. Our techniques are also implemented, and experiments show their practicality.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Algorithms Transcending the SAT-Symmetry Interface\nAbstract: Dedicated treatment of symmetries in satisfiability problems (SAT) is indispensable for solving various classes of instances arising in practice. However, the exploitation of symmetries usually takes a black box approach. Typically, off-the-shelf external, general-purpose symmetry detection tools are invoked to compute symmetry groups of a formula. The groups thus generated are a set of permutations passed to a separate tool to perform further analyzes to understand the structure of the groups. The result of this second computation is in turn used for tasks such as static symmetry breaking or dynamic pruning of the search space. Within this pipeline of tools, the detection and analysis of symmetries typically incurs the majority of the time overhead for symmetry exploitation. In this paper we advocate for a more holistic view of what we call the SAT-symmetry interface. We formulate a computational setting, centered around a new concept of joint graph/group pairs, to analyze and improve the detection and analysis of symmetries. Using our methods, no information is lost performing computational tasks lying on the SAT-symmetry interface. Having access to the entire input allows for simpler, yet efficient algorithms. Specifically, we devise algorithms and heuristics for computing finest direct disjoint decompositions, finding equivalent orbits, and finding natural symmetric group actions. Our algorithms run in what we call instance-quasi-linear time, i.e., almost linear time in terms of the input size of the original formula and the description length of the symmetry group returned by symmetry detection tools. Our algorithms improve over both heuristics used in state-of-the-art symmetry exploitation tools, as well as theoretical general-purpose algorithms.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Playing Atari with Six Neurons\nAbstract: Deep reinforcement learning, applied to vision-based problems like Atari games, maps pixels directly to actions; internally, the deep neural network bears the responsibility of both extracting useful information and making decisions based on it. By separating the image processing from decision-making, one could better understand the complexity of each task, as well as potentially find smaller policy representations that are easier for humans to understand and may generalize better. To this end, we propose a new method for learning policies and compact state representations separately but simultaneously for policy approximation in reinforcement learning. State representations are generated by an encoder based on two novel algorithms: Increasing Dictionary Vector Quantization makes the encoder capable of growing its dictionary size over time, to address new observations as they appear in an open-ended online-learning context; Direct Residuals Sparse Coding encodes observations by disregarding reconstruction error minimization, and aiming instead for highest information inclusion. The encoder autonomously selects observations online to train on, in order to maximize code sparsity. As the dictionary size increases, the encoder produces increasingly larger inputs for the neural network: this is addressed by a variation of the Exponential Natural Evolution Strategies algorithm which adapts its probability distribution dimensionality along the run. We test our system on a selection of Atari games using tiny neural networks of only 6 to 18 neurons (depending on the game's controls). These are still capable of achieving results comparable---and occasionally superior---to state-of-the-art techniques which use two orders of magnitude more neurons.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Language Models Are Greedy Reasoners: A Systematic Formal Analysis of Chain-of-Thought\nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities given chain-of-thought prompts (examples with intermediate reasoning steps). Existing benchmarks measure reasoning ability indirectly, by evaluating accuracy on downstream tasks such as mathematical reasoning. However, it is unclear how these models obtain the answers and whether they rely on simple heuristics rather than the generated chain-of-thought. To enable systematic exploration of the reasoning ability of LLMs, we present a new synthetic question-answering dataset called PrOntoQA, where each example is generated from a synthetic world model represented in first-order logic. This allows us to parse the generated chain-of-thought into symbolic proofs for formal analysis. Our analysis on InstructGPT and GPT-3 shows that LLMs are quite capable of making correct individual deduction steps, and so are generally capable of reasoning, even in fictional contexts. However, they have difficulty with proof planning: When multiple valid deduction steps are available, they are not able to systematically explore the different options.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

However, training and deploying big artificial intelligence models (BAIMs) introduces substantial computational and communication overhead.This poses a critical challenge to centralized approaches, due to the need of high-performance computing infrastructure and the reliability, secrecy and timeliness issues in long-distance access of cloud services. Therefore, there is an urging need to decentralize the services, partly moving them from the cloud to the edge and establishing native GenAI services to enable private, timely, and personalized experiences. In this paper, we propose a brand-new bottom-up BAIM architecture with synergetic big cloud model and small edge models, and design a distributed training framework and a task-oriented deployment scheme for efficient provision of native GenAI services. The proposed framework can facilitate collaborative intelligence, enhance adaptability, gather edge knowledge and alleviate edge-cloud burden.

{"text": "Title: Which Quantum Circuit Mutants Shall Be Used? An Empirical Evaluation of Quantum Circuit Mutations\nAbstract: As a new research area, quantum software testing lacks systematic testing benchmarks to assess testing techniques' effectiveness. Recently, some open-source benchmarks and mutation analysis tools have emerged. However, there is insufficient evidence on how various quantum circuit characteristics (e.g., circuit depth, number of quantum gates), algorithms (e.g., Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm), and mutation characteristics (e.g., mutation operators) affect the most mutant detection in quantum circuits. Studying such relations is important to systematically design faulty benchmarks with varied attributes (e.g., the difficulty in detecting a seeded fault) to facilitate assessing the cost-effectiveness of quantum software testing techniques efficiently. To this end, we present a large-scale empirical evaluation with more than 700K faulty benchmarks (quantum circuits) generated by mutating 382 real-world quantum circuits. Based on the results, we provide valuable insights for researchers to define systematic quantum mutation analysis techniques. We also provide a tool to recommend mutants to users based on chosen characteristics (e.g., a quantum algorithm type) and the required difficulty of killing mutants.

There has been some interest in micro-expression analysis, however, a great majority of the methods are based on classically established computer vision methods such as local binary patterns, histogram of gradients and optical flow. A novel methodology for micro-expression recognition using the Riesz pyramid, a multi-scale steerable Hilbert transform is presented. In fact, an image sequence is transformed with this tool, then the image phase variations are extracted and filtered as proxies for motion. Furthermore, the dominant orientation constancy from the Riesz transform is exploited to average the micro-expression sequence into an image pair. Based on that, the Mean Oriented Riesz Feature description is introduced. Finally the performance of our methods are tested in two spontaneous micro-expressions databases and compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

In particular, we show that the phenomenon commonly referred to as propagation failure, or wave blocking occurs in a cone in the $(c,\\epsilon)$ parameter space which emanates from the point $(c,\\epsilon)=(0,0)$.

{"text": "Title: Rewrite Caption Semantics: Bridging Semantic Gaps for Language-Supervised Semantic Segmentation\nAbstract: Vision-Language Pre-training has demonstrated its remarkable zero-shot recognition ability and potential to learn generalizable visual representations from language supervision. Taking a step ahead, language-supervised semantic segmentation enables spatial localization of textual inputs by learning pixel grouping solely from image-text pairs. Nevertheless, the state-of-the-art suffers from clear semantic gaps between visual and textual modality: plenty of visual concepts appeared in images are missing in their paired captions. Such semantic misalignment circulates in pre-training, leading to inferior zero-shot performance in dense predictions due to insufficient visual concepts captured in textual representations. To close such semantic gap, we propose Concept Curation (CoCu), a pipeline that leverages CLIP to compensate for the missing semantics. For each image-text pair, we establish a concept archive that maintains potential visually-matched concepts with our proposed vision-driven expansion and text-to-vision-guided ranking. Relevant concepts can thus be identified via cluster-guided sampling and fed into pre-training, thereby bridging the gap between visual and textual semantics. Extensive experiments over a broad suite of 8 segmentation benchmarks show that CoCu achieves superb zero-shot transfer performance and greatly boosts language-supervised segmentation baseline by a large margin, suggesting the value of bridging semantic gap in pre-training data.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

The model is criticized at times for being overly conservative since the worst-case distribution is discrete with a few support points. However, it is the order quantity prescribed from the model that is of practical relevance. A simple calculation shows that the optimal order quantity in Scarf's model with known first and second moment is also optimal for a censored student-t distribution with parameter 2. In this paper, we generalize this \"heavy-tail optimality\" property of the distributionally robust newsvendor to an ambiguity set where information on the first and the $\\alpha$th moment is known, for any real number $\\alpha > 1$. We show that the optimal order quantity for the distributionally robust newsvendor problem is also optimal for a regularly varying distribution with roughly a power law tail with tail index $\\alpha$. We illustrate the usefulness of the model in the high service level regime with numerical experiments, by showing that when a standard distribution such as the exponential or lognormal distribution is contaminated with a heavy-tailed (regularly varying) distribution, the distributionally robust optimal order quantity outperforms the optimal order quantity of the original distribution, even with a small amount of contamination.", "field": "math", "label": 1}

A significant fraction of this work focuses on lower bounds for basic communication problems such as wake-up (symmetry breaking among an unknown set of nodes) and broadcast (message dissemination through an unknown network topology). In this paper, we introduce a new technique for proving this type of bound, based on reduction from a probabilistic hitting game, that simplifies and strengthens much of this existing work. In more detail, in this single paper we prove new expected time and high probability lower bounds for wake-up and global broadcast in single and multichannel versions of the radio network model both with and without collision detection. In doing so, we are able to reproduce results that previously spanned a half-dozen papers published over a period of twenty-five years. In addition to simplifying these existing results, our technique, in many places, also improves the state of the art: of the eight bounds we prove, four strictly strengthen the best known previous result (in terms of time complexity and/or generality of the algorithm class for which it holds), and three provide the first known non-trivial bound for the case in question.

{"text": "Title: Dynamically Masked Discriminator for Generative Adversarial Networks\nAbstract: Training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) remains a challenging problem. The discriminator trains the generator by learning the distribution of real/generated data. However, the distribution of generated data changes throughout the training process, which is difficult for the discriminator to learn. In this paper, we propose a novel method for GANs from the viewpoint of online continual learning. We observe that the discriminator model, trained on historically generated data, often slows down its adaptation to the changes in the new arrival generated data, which accordingly decreases the quality of generated results. By treating the generated data in training as a stream, we propose to detect whether the discriminator slows down the learning of new knowledge in generated data. Therefore, we can explicitly enforce the discriminator to learn new knowledge fast. Particularly, we propose a new discriminator, which automatically detects its retardation and then dynamically masks its features, such that the discriminator can adaptively learn the temporally-vary distribution of generated data.

It enables StyleCLIP-like latent editing within DMs. In this paper, we explore further usage of $h$-space beyond attribute editing, and introduce a method to inject the content of one image into another image by combining their features in the generative processes. Briefly, given the original generative process of the other image, 1) we gradually blend the bottleneck feature of the content with proper normalization, and 2) we calibrate the skip connections to match the injected content. Unlike custom-diffusion approaches, our method does not require time-consuming optimization or fine-tuning. Instead, our method manipulates intermediate features within a feed-forward generative process. Furthermore, our method does not require supervision from external networks.

{"text": "Title: Multi-task learning for Joint Language Understanding and Dialogue State Tracking\nAbstract: This paper presents a novel approach for multi-task learning of language understanding (LU) and dialogue state tracking (DST) in task-oriented dialogue systems. Multi-task training enables the sharing of the neural network layers responsible for encoding the user utterance for both LU and DST and improves performance while reducing the number of network parameters. In our proposed framework, DST operates on a set of candidate values for each slot that has been mentioned so far. These candidate sets are generated using LU slot annotations for the current user utterance, dialogue acts corresponding to the preceding system utterance and the dialogue state estimated for the previous turn, enabling DST to handle slots with a large or unbounded set of possible values and deal with slot values not seen during training. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between training and inference, we investigate the use of scheduled sampling on LU output for the current user utterance as well as the DST output for the preceding turn.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: A Complete Landscape for the Price of Envy-Freeness\nAbstract: We study the efficiency of fair allocations using the well-studied price of fairness concept, which quantitatively measures the worst-case efficiency loss when imposing fairness constraints. Previous works provided partial results on the price of fairness with well-known fairness notions such as envy-freeness up to one good (EF1) and envy-freeness up to any good (EFX). In this paper, we give a complete characterization for the price of envy-freeness in various settings. In particular, we first consider the two-agent case under the indivisible-goods setting and present tight ratios for the price of EF1 (for scaled utility) and EFX (for unscaled utility), which resolve questions left open in the literature. Next, we consider the mixed goods setting which concerns a mixture of both divisible and indivisible goods. We focus on envy-freeness for mixed goods (EFM), which generalizes both envy-freeness and EF1, as well as its strengthening called envy-freeness up to any good for mixed goods (EFXM), which generalizes envy-freeness and EFX. To this end, we settle the price of EFM and EFXM by providing a complete picture of tight bounds for two agents and asymptotically tight bounds for $n$ agents, for both scaled and unscaled utilities.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: HEAP: Unsupervised Object Discovery and Localization with Contrastive Grouping\nAbstract: Unsupervised object discovery and localization aims to detect or segment objects in an image without any supervision. Recent efforts have demonstrated a notable potential to identify salient foreground objects by utilizing self-supervised transformer features. However, their scopes only build upon patch-level features within an image, neglecting region/image-level and cross-image relationships at a broader scale. Moreover, these methods cannot differentiate various semantics from multiple instances. To address these problems, we introduce Hierarchical mErging framework via contrAstive grouPing (HEAP). Specifically, a novel lightweight head with cross-attention mechanism is designed to adaptively group intra-image patches into semantically coherent regions based on correlation among self-supervised features. Further, to ensure the distinguishability among various regions, we introduce a region-level contrastive clustering loss to pull closer similar regions across images. Also, an image-level contrastive loss is present to push foreground and background representations apart, with which foreground objects and background are accordingly discovered. HEAP facilitates efficient hierarchical image decomposition, which contributes to more accurate object discovery while also enabling differentiation among objects of various classes. Extensive experimental results on semantic segmentation retrieval, unsupervised object discovery, and saliency detection tasks demonstrate that HEAP achieves state-of-the-art performance.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

Ensuring their safety through regular inspections and maintenance is crucial to prevent incidents that can significantly affect public safety and the environment. This is especially pertinent in the context of electrical power networks, which, while essential for energy provision, can also be sources of forest fires. Intelligent drones have the potential to revolutionize inspection and maintenance, eliminating the risks for human operators, increasing productivity, reducing inspection time, and improving data collection quality. However, most of the current methods and technologies in aerial robotics have been trialed primarily in indoor testbeds or outdoor settings under strictly controlled conditions, always within the line of sight of human operators. Additionally, these methods and technologies have typically been evaluated in isolation, lacking comprehensive integration. This paper introduces the first autonomous system that combines various innovative aerial robots. This system is designed for extended-range inspections beyond the visual line of sight, features aerial manipulators for maintenance tasks, and includes support mechanisms for human operators working at elevated heights.

{"text": "Title: Distributed convergence detection based on global residual error under asynchronous iterations\nAbstract: Convergence of classical parallel iterations is detected by performing a reduction operation at each iteration in order to compute a residual error relative to a potential solution vector. To efficiently run asynchronous iterations, blocking communication requests are avoided, which makes it hard to isolate and handle any global vector. While some termination protocols were proposed for asynchronous iterations, only very few of them are based on global residual computation and guarantee effective convergence. But the most effective and efficient existing solutions feature two reduction operations, which constitutes an important factor of termination delay. In this paper, we present new, non-intrusive, protocols to compute a residual error under asynchronous iterations, requiring only one reduction operation. Various communication models show that some heuristics can even be introduced and formally evaluated.

The reallocation of research efforts is shown to be structured by learning costs, thus enhancing the utility of the scientific capital disseminated among scientists. Two dimensions of social capital, namely ``diversity'' and ``power'', have opposite effects on the magnitude of change in scientists' research interests: while ``diversity'' disrupts and expands research interests, ``power'' stabilizes physicists' research agendas -- as does institutional stability.

{"text": "Title: A Novel Dual-Stage Evolutionary Algorithm for Finding Robust Solutions\nAbstract: In robust optimization problems, the magnitude of perturbations is relatively small. Consequently, solutions within certain regions are less likely to represent the robust optima when perturbations are introduced. Hence, a more efficient search process would benefit from increased opportunities to explore promising regions where global optima or good local optima are situated. In this paper, we introduce a novel robust evolutionary algorithm named the dual-stage robust evolutionary algorithm (DREA) aimed at discovering robust solutions. DREA operates in two stages: the peak-detection stage and the robust solution-searching stage. The primary objective of the peak-detection stage is to identify peaks in the fitness landscape of the original optimization problem. Conversely, the robust solution-searching stage focuses on swiftly identifying the robust optimal solution using information obtained from the peaks discovered in the initial stage. These two stages collectively enable the proposed DREA to efficiently obtain the robust optimal solution for the optimization problem. This approach achieves a balance between solution optimality and robustness by separating the search processes for optimal and robust optimal solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that DREA significantly outperforms five state-of-the-art algorithms across 18 test problems characterized by diverse complexities. Moreover, when evaluated on higher-dimensional robust optimization problems (100-$D$ and 200-$D$), DREA also demonstrates superior performance compared to all five counterpart algorithms.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

After a short cold-start phase, the stored cuts provide warm-starts for the new problem instances to enhance the solving speed. Despite the disturbance and randomly changing environment, the solving speed maintains. Leveraging on the sparsity of feasibility cuts, we also propose a fast algorithm for Benders master problems.

{"text": "Title: Where You Are Is Who You Are: User Identification by Matching Statistics\nAbstract: Most users of online services have unique behavioral or usage patterns. These behavioral patterns can be exploited to identify and track users by using only the observed patterns in the behavior. We study the task of identifying users from statistics of their behavioral patterns. Specifically, we focus on the setting in which we are given histograms of users' data collected during two different experiments. We assume that, in the first dataset, the users' identities are anonymized or hidden and that, in the second dataset, their identities are known. We study the task of identifying the users by matching the histograms of their data in the first dataset with the histograms from the second dataset. In recent works, the optimal algorithm for this user identification task is introduced. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of this method on three different types of datasets and in multiple scenarios. Using datasets such as call data records, web browsing histories, and GPS trajectories, we show that a large fraction of users can be easily identified given only histograms of their data; hence these histograms can act as users' fingerprints. We also verify that simultaneous identification of users achieves better performance compared to one-by-one user identification. We show that using the optimal method for identification gives higher identification accuracy than heuristics-based approaches in practical scenarios. The accuracy obtained under this optimal method can thus be used to quantify the maximum level of user identification that is possible in such settings. We show that the key factors affecting the accuracy of the optimal identification algorithm are the duration of the data collection, the number of users in the anonymized dataset, and the resolution of the dataset. We analyze the effectiveness of k-anonymization in resisting user identification attacks on these datasets.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Efficient Checking of Timed Order Compliance Rules over Graph-encoded Event Logs\nAbstract: Validation of compliance rules against process data is a fundamental functionality for business process management. Over the years, the problem has been addressed for different types of process data, i.e., process models, process event data at runtime, and event logs representing historical execution. Several approaches have been proposed to tackle compliance checking over process logs. These approaches have been based on different data models and storage technologies including relational databases, graph databases, and proprietary formats. Graph-based encoding of event logs is a promising direction that turns several process analytics tasks into queries on the underlying graph. Compliance checking is one class of such analysis tasks. In this paper, we argue that encoding log data as graphs alone is not enough to guarantee efficient processing of queries on this data. Efficiency is important due to the interactive nature of compliance checking. Thus, compliance checking would benefit from sub-linear scanning of the data. Moreover, as more data are added, e.g., new batches of logs arrive, the data size should grow sub-linearly to optimize both the space of storage and time for querying. We propose two encoding methods using graph representation, realized in Neo4J, and show the benefits of these encoding on a special class of queries, namely timed order compliance rules. Compared to a baseline encoding, our experiments show up to 5x speed up in the querying time as well as a 3x reduction in the graph size.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Lookahead: An Inference Acceleration Framework for Large Language Model with Lossless Generation Accuracy\nAbstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant advancements across various tasks, such as question answering, translation, text summarization, and dialogue systems, the need for accuracy in information becomes crucial, especially for serious financial products serving billions of users like Alipay. To address this, Alipay has developed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that grounds LLMs on the most accurate and up-to-date information. However, for a real-world product serving millions of users, the inference speed of LLMs becomes a critical factor compared to a mere experimental model. Hence, this paper presents a generic framework for accelerating the inference process, resulting in a substantial increase in speed and cost reduction for our RAG system, with lossless generation accuracy. In the traditional inference process, each token is generated sequentially by the LLM, leading to a time consumption proportional to the number of generated tokens. To enhance this process, our framework, named \\textit{lookahead}, introduces a \\textit{multi-branch} strategy. Instead of generating a single token at a time, we propose a \\textit{Trie-based Retrieval} (TR) process that enables the generation of multiple branches simultaneously, each of which is a sequence of tokens. Subsequently, for each branch, a \\textit{Verification and Accept} (VA) process is performed to identify the longest correct sub-sequence as the final output. Our strategy offers two distinct advantages: (1) it guarantees absolute correctness of the output, avoiding any approximation algorithms, and (2) the worst-case performance of our approach is equivalent to the conventional process. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the significant improvements achieved by applying our inference acceleration framework.

{"text": "Title: Towards Multi-Objective High-Dimensional Feature Selection via Evolutionary Multitasking\nAbstract: Evolutionary Multitasking (EMT) paradigm, an emerging research topic in evolutionary computation, has been successfully applied in solving high-dimensional feature selection (FS) problems recently. However, existing EMT-based FS methods suffer from several limitations, such as a single mode of multitask generation, conducting the same generic evolutionary search for all tasks, relying on implicit transfer mechanisms through sole solution encodings, and employing single-objective transformation, which result in inadequate knowledge acquisition, exploitation, and transfer. To this end, this paper develops a novel EMT framework for multiobjective high-dimensional feature selection problems, namely MO-FSEMT. In particular, multiple auxiliary tasks are constructed by distinct formulation methods to provide diverse search spaces and information representations and then simultaneously addressed with the original task through a multi-slover-based multitask optimization scheme. Each task has an independent population with task-specific representations and is solved using separate evolutionary solvers with different biases and search preferences. A task-specific knowledge transfer mechanism is designed to leverage the advantage information of each task, enabling the discovery and effective transmission of high-quality solutions during the search process. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our MO-FSEMT framework can achieve overall superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art FS methods on 26 datasets.

Given that each neural coding scheme possesses its own merits and drawbacks, these SNNs encounter challenges in achieving optimal performance such as accuracy, response time, efficiency, and robustness, all of which are crucial for practical applications. In this study, we argue that SNN architectures should be holistically designed to incorporate heterogeneous coding schemes.

Additionally, it incorporates a flexible neural coding assignment strategy to accommodate task-specific requirements, along with novel layer-wise learning methods to effectively implement hybrid coding SNNs. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework on image classification and sound localization tasks. Specifically, the proposed hybrid coding SNNs achieve comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art SNNs, while exhibiting significantly reduced inference latency and energy consumption, as well as high noise robustness.

{"text": "Title: Significance of Anatomical Constraints in Virtual Try-On\nAbstract: The system of Virtual Try-ON (VTON) allows a user to try a product virtually. In general, a VTON system takes a clothing source and a person's image to predict the try-on output of the person in the given clothing. Although existing methods perform well for simple poses, in case of bent or crossed arms posture or when there is a significant difference between the alignment of the source clothing and the pose of the target person, these methods fail by generating inaccurate clothing deformations. In the VTON methods that employ Thin Plate Spline (TPS) based clothing transformations, this mainly occurs for two reasons - (1)~the second-order smoothness constraint of TPS that restricts the bending of the object plane. (2)~Overlaps among different clothing parts (e.g., sleeves and torso) can not be modeled by a single TPS transformation, as it assumes the clothing as a single planar object; therefore, disregards the independence of movement of different clothing parts. To this end, we make two major contributions. Concerning the bending limitations of TPS, we propose a human AnaTomy-Aware Geometric (ATAG) transformation. Regarding the overlap issue, we propose a part-based warping approach that divides the clothing into independently warpable parts to warp them separately and later combine them.

In the era of digitalization, the research and development of new technologies is crucial for improving integration processes. Numerous challenges, including the lack of standardization, as well as intricate stakeholder relationships, complicate the process of robotic systems integration. This process typically consists of acquisition, integration, and deployment of the robot systems. This thesis focuses on three areas that help automate and simplify robotic systems integration. In the first area, related to acquisition, a constraint-based configurator is demonstrated that resolves compatibility challenges between robot devices, and automates the configuration process. This reduces the risk of integrating incompatible devices and decreases the need for experts during the configuration phase. In the second area, related to integration, the interoperable modeling format, Unified Robot Description Format (URDF), is investigated, where a detailed analysis is performed, revealing significant inconsistencies and critical improvements. This format is widely used for kinematic modeling and 3D visualization of robots, and its models can be reused across simulation tools. Improving this format benefits a wide range of users, including robotics engineers, researchers, and students. In the third area, related to deployment, Digital Twins (DTs) for robot systems are explored, as these improve efficiency and reduce downtime. A comprehensive literature review of DTs is conducted, and a case study of modular robot systems is developed. This research can accelerate the adoption of DTs in the robotics industry.

{"text": "Title: Leader Election Problem Versus Pattern Formation Problem\nAbstract: Leader election and arbitrary pattern formation are funda- mental tasks for a set of autonomous mobile robots. The former consists in distinguishing a unique robot, called the leader. The latter aims in arranging the robots in the plane to form any given pattern. The solv- ability of both these tasks turns out to be necessary in order to achieve more complex tasks. In this paper, we study the relationship between these two tasks in a model, called CORDA, wherein the robots are weak in several aspects. In particular, they are fully asynchronous and they have no direct means of communication. They cannot remember any previous observation nor computation performed in any previous step. Such robots are said to be oblivious. The robots are also uniform and anonymous, i.e, they all have the same program using no global parameter (such as an identity) allowing to differentiate any of them. Moreover, we assume that none of them share any kind of common coordinate mechanism or common sense of direction and we discuss the influence of a common handedness (i.e., chirality). In such a system, Flochini et al. proved in [11] that it is possible to elect a leader for n \\geq 3 robots if it is possible to form any pattern for n \\geq 3. In this paper, we show that the converse is true for n \\geq 4 when the robots share a common handedness and for n \\geq 5 when they do not.

Our initial experiments show that neural machine translation models can indeed learn in such a setup and we can show that the learning algorithm picks up information about the relation between languages in order to optimize transfer leaning with shared parameters.

{"text": "Title: QoE-oriented Dependent Task Scheduling under Multi-dimensional QoS Constraints over Distributed Networks\nAbstract: Task scheduling as an effective strategy can improve application performance on computing resource-limited devices over distributed networks. However, existing evaluation mechanisms fail to depict the complexity of diverse applications, which involve dependencies among tasks, computing resource requirements, and multi-dimensional quality of service (QoS) constraints. Furthermore, traditional QoS-oriented task scheduling strategies struggle to meet the performance requirements without considering differences in satisfaction and acceptance of application, leading application failures and resource wastage. To tackle these issues, a quality of experience (QoE) cost model is designed to evaluate application completion, depicting the relationship among application satisfaction, communications, and computing resources in the distributed networks. Specifically, considering the sensitivity and preference of QoS, we model the different dimensional QoS degradation cost functions for dependent tasks, which are then integrated into the QoE cost model. Based on the QoE model, the dependent task scheduling problem is formulated as the minimization of overall QoE cost, aiming to improve the application performance in the distributed networks, which is proven Np-hard. Moreover, a heuristic Hierarchical Multi-queue Task Scheduling Algorithm (HMTSA) is proposed to address the QoE-oriented task scheduling problem among multiple dependent tasks, which utilizes hierarchical multiple queues to determine the optimal task execution order and location according to different dimensional QoS priorities.

In the case where the system is not rigid, its inclusion-wise maximal rigid substructures (rigid components) are also combinatorially characterized via the Maxwell-Laman theorem, and may be found efficiently. Physicists have used planar combinatorial rigidity has been used to study the phase transition between liquid and solid in network glasses. The approach has been to generate a graph via a stochastic process and then experimentally analyze its rigidity properties. Of particular interest is the size of the largest rigid components. In this paper, we study the emergence of rigid components in an Erdos-Renyi random graph G(n,p), using the parameterization p=c/n for a fixed constant c>0. Our first result is that for all c>0, almost surely all rigid components have size 2, 3 or Omega(n). We also show that for c>4, almost surely the largest rigid components have size at least n/10. While the G(n,p) model is simpler than those appearing in the physics literature, these results are the first of this type where the distribution is over all graphs on n vertices and the expected number of edges is O(n).", "field": "math", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Open Gromov-Witten invariants from the Fukaya category\nAbstract: This paper proposes a framework to show that the Fukaya category of a symplectic manifold $X$ determines the open Gromov-Witten invariants of Lagrangians $L \\subset X$. We associate to an object in an $A_\\infty$-category an extension of the negative cyclic homology, called \\emph{relative cyclic homology}. We extend the Getzler-Gauss-Manin connection to relative cyclic homology. Then, we construct (under simplifying technical assumptions) a relative cyclic open-closed map, which maps the relative cyclic homology of a Lagrangian $L$ in the Fukaya category of a symplectic manifold $X$ to the $S^1$-equivariant relative quantum homology of $(X,L)$. Relative quantum homology is the dual to the relative quantum cohomology constructed by Solomon-Tukachinsky. This is an extension of quantum cohomology, and comes equipped with a connection extending the quantum connection. We prove that the relative open-closed map respects connections. As an application of this framework, we show, assuming a construction of the relative cyclic open-closed map in a broader technical setup, that the Fukaya category of a Calabi-Yau variety determines the open Gromov-Witten invariants with one interior marked point for any null-homologous Lagrangian brane.", "field": "math", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Energy balance and damage for brittle fracture: nonlocal formulation\nAbstract: A nonlocal model of peridynamic type for dynamic brittle damage is introduced consisting of two phases, one elastic and the other inelastic. Evolution from the elastic to the inelastic phase depends on material strength. Here inelasticity corresponds to material failure. Existence and uniqueness of the elastic displacement-failure set pair follow from the initial value problem. The displacement-failure pair satisfies energy balance. The length scale of nonlocality $\\epsilon$ is taken to be small relative to the domain in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, $d=2,3$. The new nonlocal model delivers a two point strain dynamics on a subset of $\\mathbb{R}^d\\times\\mathbb{R}^d$. This dynamics provides an energy that interpolates between volume energy corresponding to recoverable strain and surface energy corresponding to non recoverable strain. The deformation energy resulting in material failure over a region $R$ is given by a $d-1$ dimensional integral that is uniformly bounded as $\\epsilon\\rightarrow 0$. For fixed $\\epsilon$, this energy is nonzero for $d-1$ dimensional regions $R$ associated with flat crack surfaces. The failure energy is the Griffith fracture energy for a given crack $R$ in terms of its area for $d=3$ (or length for $d=2$). This energy follows directly from the nonlocal model without sending $\\epsilon$ to zero. Simulations illustrate fracture evolution through generation of an internal traction free boundary as a wake left behind a moving strain concentration. Crack paths are seen to follow a maximal strain energy density criterion.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

The joint distribution of the inter-arrival times (which are dependent) is the Multivariate Exp-Min-U-Exp distribution of $II^{-nd}$ kind. Its univariate and multivariate versions are described, and the formulae for their numerical characteristics are obtained. The distribution of the moments of arrival of different events is called Erlang-Min-U-Exp. Different properties of these distributions are obtained, and their numerical characteristics are computed. Multivariate ordered Mixed Poisson-Min-U-Exp distribution describes the joint distribution of the time-intersection of a Mixed Poisson process with Min-U-Exp mixing variable.

{"text": "Title: Xorbits: Automating Operator Tiling for Distributed Data Science\nAbstract: Data science pipelines commonly utilize dataframe and array operations for tasks such as data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning. The most popular tools for these tasks are pandas and NumPy. However, these tools are limited to executing on a single node, making them unsuitable for processing large-scale data. Several systems have attempted to distribute data science applications to clusters while maintaining interfaces similar to single-node libraries, enabling data scientists to scale their workloads without significant effort. However, existing systems often struggle with processing large datasets due to Out-of-Memory (OOM) problems caused by poor data partitioning. To overcome these challenges, we develop Xorbits, a high-performance, scalable data science framework specifically designed to distribute data science workloads across clusters while retaining familiar APIs. The key differentiator of Xorbits is its ability to dynamically switch between graph construction and graph execution. Xorbits has been successfully deployed in production environments with up to 5k CPU cores. Its applications span various domains, including user behavior analysis and recommendation systems in the e-commerce sector, as well as credit assessment and risk management in the finance industry. Users can easily scale their data science workloads by simply changing the import line of their pandas and NumPy code. Our experiments demonstrate that Xorbits can effectively process very large datasets without encountering OOM or data-skewing problems. Over the fastest state-of-the-art solutions, Xorbits achieves an impressive 2.66* speedup on average. In terms of API coverage, Xorbits attains a compatibility rate of 96.7%, surpassing the fastest framework by an impressive margin of 60 percentage points.

{"text": "Title: Energy-optimal Timetable Design for Sustainable Metro Railway Networks\nAbstract: We present our collaboration with Thales Canada Inc, the largest provider of communication-based train control (CBTC) systems worldwide. We study the problem of designing energy-optimal timetables in metro railway networks to minimize the effective energy consumption of the network, which corresponds to simultaneously minimizing total energy consumed by all the trains and maximizing the transfer of regenerative braking energy from suitable braking trains to accelerating trains. We propose a novel data-driven linear programming model that minimizes the total effective energy consumption in a metro railway network, capable of computing the optimal timetable in real-time, even for some of the largest CBTC systems in the world. In contrast with existing works, which are either NP-hard or involve multiple stages requiring extensive simulation, our model is a single linear programming model capable of computing the energy-optimal timetable subject to the constraints present in the railway network. Furthermore, our model can predict the total energy consumption of the network without requiring time-consuming simulations, making it suitable for widespread use in managerial settings. We apply our model to Shanghai Railway Network's Metro Line 8 -- one of the largest and busiest railway services in the world -- and empirically demonstrate that our model computes energy-optimal timetables for thousands of active trains spanning an entire service period of one day in real-time (solution time less than one second on a standard desktop), achieving energy savings between approximately 20.93% and 28.68%.

However, in order to exploit this new generation of computer chips, rigorous simulation and consequent validation of brain-based experimental data is imperative. In this work, we investigate the potential of Intel's fifth generation neuromorphic chip - `Loihi', which is based on the novel idea of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emulating the neurons in the brain. The work is implemented in context of simulating the Leaky Integrate and Fire (LIF) models based on the mouse primary visual cortex matched to a rich data set of anatomical, physiological and behavioral constraints.

{"text": "Title: From Function to Distribution Modeling: A PAC-Generative Approach to Offline Optimization\nAbstract: This paper considers the problem of offline optimization, where the objective function is unknown except for a collection of ``offline\" data examples. While recent years have seen a flurry of work on applying various machine learning techniques to the offline optimization problem, the majority of these work focused on learning a surrogate of the unknown objective function and then applying existing optimization algorithms. While the idea of modeling the unknown objective function is intuitive and appealing, from the learning point of view it also makes it very difficult to tune the objective of the learner according to the objective of optimization. Instead of learning and then optimizing the unknown objective function, in this paper we take on a less intuitive but more direct view that optimization can be thought of as a process of sampling from a generative model. To learn an effective generative model from the offline data examples, we consider the standard technique of ``re-weighting\", and our main technical contribution is a probably approximately correct (PAC) lower bound on the natural optimization objective, which allows us to jointly learn a weight function and a score-based generative model. The robustly competitive performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated via empirical studies using the standard offline optimization benchmarks.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

Furthermore, the curvature of the connection measures the failure of the horizontal space $H_\\nabla$ to be integrable.

{"text": "Title: Can AI Be as Creative as Humans?\nAbstract: Creativity serves as a cornerstone for societal progress and innovation, but its assessment remains a complex and often subjective endeavor. With the rise of advanced generative AI models capable of tasks once reserved for human creativity, the study of AI's creative potential becomes imperative for its responsible development and application. This paper addresses the complexities in defining and evaluating creativity by introducing a new concept called Relative Creativity. Instead of trying to define creativity universally, we shift the focus to whether AI can match the creative abilities of a hypothetical human. This perspective draws inspiration from the Turing Test, expanding upon it to address the challenges and subjectivities inherent in evaluating creativity. This methodological shift facilitates a statistically quantifiable evaluation of AI's creativity, which we term Statistical Creativity. This approach allows for direct comparisons of AI's creative abilities with those of specific human groups. Building on this foundation, we discuss the application of statistical creativity in contemporary prompt-conditioned autoregressive models. In addition to defining and analyzing a measure of creativity, we introduce an actionable training guideline, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical quantification of creativity and practical model training. Through these multifaceted contributions, the paper establishes a cohesive, continuously evolving, and transformative framework for assessing and fostering statistical creativity in AI models.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Stochastic Broadcast Control of Multi-Agent Swarms\nAbstract: We present a model for controlling swarms of mobile agents via broadcast control, assumed to be detected by a random set of agents in the swarm. The agents that detect the control signal become ad-hoc leaders of the swarm. The agents are assumed to be velocity controlled, identical, anonymous, memory-less units with limited capabilities of sensing their neighborhood. Each agent is programmed to behave according to a linear local gathering process, based on the relative position of all its neighbors. The detected exogenous control, which is a desired velocity vector, is added by the leaders to the local gathering control. The graph induced by the agents adjacency is referred to as the visibility graph. We show that for piece-wise constant system parameters and a connected visibility graph, the swarm asymptotically aligns in each time-interval on a line in the direction of the exogenous control signal, and all the agents move with identical speed. These results hold for two models of pairwise influence in the gathering process, uniform and scaled. The impact of the influence model is mostly evident when the visibility graph is incomplete. These results are conditioned by the preservation of the connectedness of the visibility graph. In the second part of the report we analyze sufficient conditions for preserving the connectedness of the visibility graph. We show that if the visibility graph is complete then certain bounds on the control signal suffice to preserve the completeness of the graph. However, when the graph is incomplete, general conditions, independent of the leaders topology, could not be found.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

This paper broadens the design space, by presenting a framework for applying Monte Carlo and variational inference algorithms when proposal densities cannot be exactly evaluated. Our framework, recursive auxiliary-variable inference (RAVI), instead approximates the necessary densities using meta-inference: an additional layer of Monte Carlo or variational inference, that targets the proposal, rather than the model. RAVI generalizes and unifies several existing methods for inference with expressive approximating families, which we show correspond to specific choices of meta-inference algorithm, and provides new theory for analyzing their bias and variance.

To fill this gap, we present an extensive analysis of how each stage of the process (i.e.~supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reward modelling, and RLHF) affects two key properties: out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation and output diversity. OOD generalisation is crucial given the wide range of real-world scenarios in which these models are being used, while output diversity refers to the model's ability to generate varied outputs and is important for a variety of use cases. We perform our analysis across two base models on both summarisation and instruction following tasks, the latter being highly relevant for current LLM use cases. We find that RLHF generalises better than SFT to new inputs, particularly as the distribution shift between train and test becomes larger. However, RLHF significantly reduces output diversity compared to SFT across a variety of measures, implying a tradeoff in current LLM fine-tuning methods between generalisation and diversity. Our results provide guidance on which fine-tuning method should be used depending on the application, and show that more research is needed to improve the tradeoff between generalisation and diversity.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Assistive Tele-op: Leveraging Transformers to Collect Robotic Task Demonstrations\nAbstract: Sharing autonomy between robots and human operators could facilitate data collection of robotic task demonstrations to continuously improve learned models. Yet, the means to communicate intent and reason about the future are disparate between humans and robots. We present Assistive Tele-op, a virtual reality (VR) system for collecting robot task demonstrations that displays an autonomous trajectory forecast to communicate the robot's intent. As the robot moves, the user can switch between autonomous and manual control when desired. This allows users to collect task demonstrations with both a high success rate and with greater ease than manual teleoperation systems. Our system is powered by transformers, which can provide a window of potential states and actions far into the future -- with almost no added computation time. A key insight is that human intent can be injected at any location within the transformer sequence if the user decides that the model-predicted actions are inappropriate. At every time step, the user can (1) do nothing and allow autonomous operation to continue while observing the robot's future plan sequence, or (2) take over and momentarily prescribe a different set of actions to nudge the model back on track.

{"text": "Title: Federated Class-Incremental Learning with Prototype Guided Transformer\nAbstract: Existing federated learning methods have effectively addressed decentralized learning in scenarios involving data privacy and non-IID data. However, in real-world situations, each client dynamically learns new classes, requiring the global model to maintain discriminative capabilities for both new and old classes. To effectively mitigate the effects of catastrophic forgetting and data heterogeneity under low communication costs, we designed a simple and effective method named PLoRA. On the one hand, we adopt prototype learning to learn better feature representations and leverage the heuristic information between prototypes and class features to design a prototype re-weight module to solve the classifier bias caused by data heterogeneity without retraining the classification layer. On the other hand, our approach utilizes a pre-trained model as the backbone and utilizes LoRA to fine-tune with a tiny amount of parameters when learning new classes. Moreover, PLoRA does not rely on similarity-based module selection strategies, thereby further reducing communication overhead. Experimental results on standard datasets indicate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches significantly. More importantly, our method exhibits strong robustness and superiority in various scenarios and degrees of data heterogeneity. Our code will be publicly available.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Towards Open Set Deep Networks\nAbstract: Deep networks have produced significant gains for various visual recognition problems, leading to high impact academic and commercial applications. Recent work in deep networks highlighted that it is easy to generate images that humans would never classify as a particular object class, yet networks classify such images high confidence as that given class - deep network are easily fooled with images humans do not consider meaningful. The closed set nature of deep networks forces them to choose from one of the known classes leading to such artifacts. Recognition in the real world is open set, i.e. the recognition system should reject unknown/unseen classes at test time. We present a methodology to adapt deep networks for open set recognition, by introducing a new model layer, OpenMax, which estimates the probability of an input being from an unknown class. A key element of estimating the unknown probability is adapting Meta-Recognition concepts to the activation patterns in the penultimate layer of the network. OpenMax allows rejection of \"fooling\" and unrelated open set images presented to the system; OpenMax greatly reduces the number of obvious errors made by a deep network. We prove that the OpenMax concept provides bounded open space risk, thereby formally providing an open set recognition solution. We evaluate the resulting open set deep networks using pre-trained networks from the Caffe Model-zoo on ImageNet 2012 validation data, and thousands of fooling and open set images. The proposed OpenMax model significantly outperforms open set recognition accuracy of basic deep networks as well as deep networks with thresholding of SoftMax probabilities.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: StROL: Stabilized and Robust Online Learning from Humans\nAbstract: Robots often need to learn the human's reward function online, during the current interaction. This real-time learning requires fast but approximate learning rules: when the human's behavior is noisy or suboptimal, current approximations can result in unstable robot learning. Accordingly, in this paper we seek to enhance the robustness and convergence properties of gradient descent learning rules when inferring the human's reward parameters. We model the robot's learning algorithm as a dynamical system over the human preference parameters, where the human's true (but unknown) preferences are the equilibrium point. This enables us to perform Lyapunov stability analysis to derive the conditions under which the robot's learning dynamics converge. Our proposed algorithm (StROL) uses these conditions to learn robust-by-design learning rules: given the original learning dynamics, StROL outputs a modified learning rule that now converges to the human's true parameters under a larger set of human inputs. In practice, these autonomously generated learning rules can correctly infer what the human is trying to convey, even when the human is noisy, biased, and suboptimal. Across simulations and a user study we find that StROL results in a more accurate estimate and less regret than state-of-the-art approaches for online reward learning.

{"text": "Title: Smoothing Methods for Automatic Differentiation Across Conditional Branches\nAbstract: Programs involving discontinuities introduced by control flow constructs such as conditional branches pose challenges to mathematical optimization methods that assume a degree of smoothness in the objective function's response surface. Smooth interpretation (SI) is a form of abstract interpretation that approximates the convolution of a program's output with a Gaussian kernel, thus smoothing its output in a principled manner. Here, we combine SI with automatic differentiation (AD) to efficiently compute gradients of smoothed programs. In contrast to AD across a regular program execution, these gradients also capture the effects of alternative control flow paths. The combination of SI with AD enables the direct gradient-based parameter synthesis for branching programs, allowing for instance the calibration of simulation models or their combination with neural network models in machine learning pipelines. We detail the effects of the approximations made for tractability in SI and propose a novel Monte Carlo estimator that avoids the underlying assumptions by estimating the smoothed programs' gradients through a combination of AD and sampling. Using DiscoGrad, our tool for automatically translating simple C++ programs to a smooth differentiable form, we perform an extensive evaluation. We compare the combination of SI with AD and our Monte Carlo estimator to existing gradient-free and stochastic methods on four non-trivial and originally discontinuous problems ranging from classical simulation-based optimization to neural network-driven control. While the optimization progress with the SI-based estimator depends on the complexity of the program's control flow, our Monte Carlo estimator is competitive in all problems, exhibiting the fastest convergence by a substantial margin in our highest-dimensional problem.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

Under the variance reduction framework, we not only analyze the subsequential and global convergence of the proposed algorithm under certain conditions, but also analyze the sublinear convergence rate of the subsequence, and the complexity of the algorithm, revealing that the BPSGE algorithm requires at most O(epsilon\\^\\,(-2)) iterations in expectation to attain an epsilon-stationary point. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, we conduct numerical experiments on three real-world applications: graph regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), matrix factorization with weakly-convex regularization, and NMF with nonconvex sparsity constraints. These experiments demonstrate that BPSGE is faster than the baselines without extrapolation.", "field": "math", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Estimating Categorical Counterfactuals via Deep Twin Networks\nAbstract: Counterfactual inference is a powerful tool, capable of solving challenging problems in high-profile sectors. To perform counterfactual inference, one requires knowledge of the underlying causal mechanisms. However, causal mechanisms cannot be uniquely determined from observations and interventions alone. This raises the question of how to choose the causal mechanisms so that resulting counterfactual inference is trustworthy in a given domain. This question has been addressed in causal models with binary variables, but the case of categorical variables remains unanswered. We address this challenge by introducing for causal models with categorical variables the notion of counterfactual ordering, a principle that posits desirable properties causal mechanisms should posses, and prove that it is equivalent to specific functional constraints on the causal mechanisms. To learn causal mechanisms satisfying these constraints, and perform counterfactual inference with them, we introduce deep twin networks. These are deep neural networks that, when trained, are capable of twin network counterfactual inference -- an alternative to the abduction, action, & prediction method. We empirically test our approach on diverse real-world and semi-synthetic data from medicine, epidemiology, and finance, reporting accurate estimation of counterfactual probabilities while demonstrating the issues that arise with counterfactual reasoning when counterfactual ordering is not enforced.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Unsupervised learning from videos using temporal coherency deep networks\nAbstract: In this work we address the challenging problem of unsupervised learning from videos. Existing methods utilize the spatio-temporal continuity in contiguous video frames as regularization for the learning process. Typically, this temporal coherence of close frames is used as a free form of annotation, encouraging the learned representations to exhibit small differences between these frames. But this type of approach fails to capture the dissimilarity between videos with different content, hence learning less discriminative features. We here propose two Siamese architectures for Convolutional Neural Networks, and their corresponding novel loss functions, to learn from unlabeled videos, which jointly exploit the local temporal coherence between contiguous frames, and a global discriminative margin used to separate representations of different videos. An extensive experimental evaluation is presented, where we validate the proposed models on various tasks. First, we show how the learned features can be used to discover actions and scenes in video collections. Second, we show the benefits of such an unsupervised learning from just unlabeled videos, which can be directly used as a prior for the supervised recognition tasks of actions and objects in images, where our results further show that our features can even surpass a traditional and heavily supervised pre-training plus fine-tunning strategy.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

The present paper provides a characterisation of elementary fibrations based on particular structures in the fibres, called transporters.

While simple to state, this has been a particularly challenging problem in deep learning, where models often end up making overconfident predictions in such situations. In this work we present a simple, but highly effective approach to deal with out-of-distribution detection that uses the principle of abstention: when encountering a sample from an unseen class, the desired behavior is to abstain from predicting. Our approach uses a network with an extra abstention class and is trained on a dataset that is augmented with an uncurated set that consists of a large number of out-of-distribution (OoD) samples that are assigned the label of the abstention class; the model is then trained to learn an effective discriminator between in and out-of-distribution samples. We compare this relatively simple approach against a wide variety of more complex methods that have been proposed both for out-of-distribution detection as well as uncertainty modeling in deep learning, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness on a wide variety of of benchmarks and deep architectures for image recognition and text classification, often outperforming existing approaches by significant margins.

The main result consists in showing that, if such a manifold (not necessarily compact or even complete) lies outside of the five classes -- a non-vacuous assumption -- then, at all points of a dense open subset, Ric has four distinct eigenvalues, while suitable local coordinates simultaneously diagonalize Ric, the metric and, in a natural sense, also the curvature tensor. Furthermore, in a local orthonormal frame formed by Ricci eigenvectors, the connection form (or, curvature tensor) has just twelve (or, respectively, six) possibly-nonzero components, which together satisfy a specific system, not depending on the point, of homogeneous polynomial equations.

{"text": "Title: LLM4TS: Aligning Pre-Trained LLMs as Data-Efficient Time-Series Forecasters\nAbstract: Multivariate time-series forecasting is vital in various domains, e.g., economic planning and weather prediction. Deep train-from-scratch models have exhibited effective performance yet require large amounts of data, which limits real-world applicability. Recently, researchers have explored pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) for limited non-linguistic datasets. However, incorporating LLMs with time-series data presents challenges of limited adaptation due to different compositions between time-series and linguistic data, and the inability to process multi-scale temporal information. To tackle these challenges, we propose LLM4TS, a framework for time-series forecasting with pre-trained LLMs. LLM4TS consists of a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the time-series alignment stage to align LLMs with the nuances of time-series data, and the forecasting fine-tuning stage, which is specifically designed for time-series forecasting tasks. Furthermore, our framework features a novel two-level aggregation method that integrates multi-scale temporal data within pre-trained LLMs, enhancing their ability to interpret time-specific information. In experiments across 7 time-series forecasting datasets, LLM4TS is superior to existing state-of-the-art methods, including those trained from scratch, in full-shot scenarios, and also achieves an average improvement of 6.84% in MSE in few-shot scenarios.

While the issue of interpretability has been emphasized in other fields like medicine, it has not received attention in music-related tasks. In this study, we explored the relevance of interpretability in the context of automatic music tagging. We constructed a workflow that incorporates three different information extraction techniques: a) leveraging symbolic knowledge, b) utilizing auxiliary deep neural networks, and c) employing signal processing to extract perceptual features from audio files. These features were subsequently used to train an interpretable machine-learning model for tag prediction. We conducted experiments on two datasets, namely the MTG-Jamendo dataset and the GTZAN dataset. Our method surpassed the performance of baseline models in both tasks and, in certain instances, demonstrated competitiveness with the current state-of-the-art. We conclude that there are use cases where the deterioration in performance is outweighed by the value of interpretability.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: On the hardness of learning under symmetries\nAbstract: We study the problem of learning equivariant neural networks via gradient descent. The incorporation of known symmetries (\"equivariance\") into neural nets has empirically improved the performance of learning pipelines, in domains ranging from biology to computer vision. However, a rich yet separate line of learning theoretic research has demonstrated that actually learning shallow, fully-connected (i.e. non-symmetric) networks has exponential complexity in the correlational statistical query (CSQ) model, a framework encompassing gradient descent. In this work, we ask: are known problem symmetries sufficient to alleviate the fundamental hardness of learning neural nets with gradient descent? We answer this question in the negative. In particular, we give lower bounds for shallow graph neural networks, convolutional networks, invariant polynomials, and frame-averaged networks for permutation subgroups, which all scale either superpolynomially or exponentially in the relevant input dimension. Therefore, in spite of the significant inductive bias imparted via symmetry, actually learning the complete classes of functions represented by equivariant neural networks via gradient descent remains hard.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Verifiable Computation with Massively Parallel Interactive Proofs\nAbstract: As the cloud computing paradigm has gained prominence, the need for verifiable computation has grown increasingly urgent. The concept of verifiable computation enables a weak client to outsource difficult computations to a powerful, but untrusted, server. Protocols for verifiable computation aim to provide the client with a guarantee that the server performed the requested computations correctly, without requiring the client to perform the computations herself. By design, these protocols impose a minimal computational burden on the client. However, existing protocols require the server to perform a large amount of extra bookkeeping in order to enable a client to easily verify the results. Verifiable computation has thus remained a theoretical curiosity, and protocols for it have not been implemented in real cloud computing systems. Our goal is to leverage GPUs to reduce the server-side slowdown for verifiable computation. To this end, we identify abundant data parallelism in a state-of-the-art general-purpose protocol for verifiable computation, originally due to Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum, and recently extended by Cormode, Mitzenmacher, and Thaler. We implement this protocol on the GPU, obtaining 40-120x server-side speedups relative to a state-of-the-art sequential implementation. For benchmark problems, our implementation reduces the slowdown of the server to factors of 100-500x relative to the original computations requested by the client. Furthermore, we reduce the already small runtime of the client by 100x. Similarly, we obtain 20-50x server-side and client-side speedups for related protocols targeted at specific streaming problems. We believe our results demonstrate the immediate practicality of using GPUs for verifiable computation, and more generally that protocols for verifiable computation have become sufficiently mature to deploy in real cloud computing systems.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

The conventional bounds on GMRES convergence involve polynomial approximation problems in the complex plane. Three popular approaches pose this approximation problem on the spectrum, the field of values, or pseudospectra of the coefficient matrix. We analyze and compare these bounds, illustrating with six examples the success and failure of each. When the matrix departs from normality due only to a low-dimensional invariant subspace, we discuss how these bounds can be adapted to exploit this structure. Since the Arnoldi process that underpins GMRES provides approximations to the pseudospectra, one can estimate the GMRES convergence bounds as an iteration proceeds.", "field": "math", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Discovery of Causal Additive Models in the Presence of Unobserved Variables\nAbstract: Causal discovery from data affected by unobserved variables is an important but difficult problem to solve. The effects that unobserved variables have on the relationships between observed variables are more complex in nonlinear cases than in linear cases. In this study, we focus on causal additive models in the presence of unobserved variables. Causal additive models exhibit structural equations that are additive in the variables and error terms. We take into account the presence of not only unobserved common causes but also unobserved intermediate variables. Our theoretical results show that, when the causal relationships are nonlinear and there are unobserved variables, it is not possible to identify all the causal relationships between observed variables through regression and independence tests. However, our theoretical results also show that it is possible to avoid incorrect inferences. We propose a method to identify all the causal relationships that are theoretically possible to identify without being biased by unobserved variables. The empirical results using artificial data and simulated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data show that our method effectively infers causal structures in the presence of unobserved variables.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Semi-supervised Contrastive Outlier removal for Pseudo Expectation Maximization (SCOPE)\nAbstract: Semi-supervised learning is the problem of training an accurate predictive model by combining a small labeled dataset with a presumably much larger unlabeled dataset. Many methods for semi-supervised deep learning have been developed, including pseudolabeling, consistency regularization, and contrastive learning techniques. Pseudolabeling methods however are highly susceptible to confounding, in which erroneous pseudolabels are assumed to be true labels in early iterations, thereby causing the model to reinforce its prior biases and thereby fail to generalize to strong predictive performance. We present a new approach to suppress confounding errors through a method we describe as Semi-supervised Contrastive Outlier removal for Pseudo Expectation Maximization (SCOPE). Like basic pseudolabeling, SCOPE is related to Expectation Maximization (EM), a latent variable framework which can be extended toward understanding cluster-assumption deep semi-supervised algorithms. However, unlike basic pseudolabeling which fails to adequately take into account the probability of the unlabeled samples given the model, SCOPE introduces an outlier suppression term designed to improve the behavior of EM iteration given a discrimination DNN backbone in the presence of outliers. Our results show that SCOPE greatly improves semi-supervised classification accuracy over a baseline, and furthermore when combined with consistency regularization achieves the highest reported accuracy for the semi-supervised CIFAR-10 classification task using 250 and 4000 labeled samples. Moreover, we show that SCOPE reduces the prevalence of confounding errors during pseudolabeling iterations by pruning erroneous high-confidence pseudolabeled samples that would otherwise contaminate the labeled set in subsequent retraining iterations.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

The task is presented to the agent as an image and an instruction specifying the goal. This meta-controller guides the agent towards its goal by designing a sequence of smaller subtasks on the part of the state space within the attention, effectively decomposing it.

{"text": "Title: Error Forward-Propagation: Reusing Feedforward Connections to Propagate Errors in Deep Learning\nAbstract: We introduce Error Forward-Propagation, a biologically plausible mechanism to propagate error feedback forward through the network. Architectural constraints on connectivity are virtually eliminated for error feedback in the brain; systematic backward connectivity is not used or needed to deliver error feedback. Feedback as a means of assigning credit to neurons earlier in the forward pathway for their contribution to the final output is thought to be used in learning in the brain. How the brain solves the credit assignment problem is unclear. In machine learning, error backpropagation is a highly successful mechanism for credit assignment in deep multilayered networks. Backpropagation requires symmetric reciprocal connectivity for every neuron. From a biological perspective, there is no evidence of such an architectural constraint, which makes backpropagation implausible for learning in the brain. This architectural constraint is reduced with the use of random feedback weights. Models using random feedback weights require backward connectivity patterns for every neuron, but avoid symmetric weights and reciprocal connections. In this paper, we practically remove this architectural constraint, requiring only a backward loop connection for effective error feedback. We propose reusing the forward connections to deliver the error feedback by feeding the outputs into the input receiving layer. This mechanism, Error Forward-Propagation, is a plausible basis for how error feedback occurs deep in the brain independent of and yet in support of the functionality underlying intricate network architectures. We show experimentally that recurrent neural networks with two and three hidden layers can be trained using Error Forward-Propagation on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, achieving $1.90\\%$ and $11\\%$ generalization errors respectively.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Principled network extraction from images\nAbstract: Images of natural systems may represent patterns of network-like structure, which could reveal important information about the topological properties of the underlying subject. However, the image itself does not automatically provide a formal definition of a network in terms of sets of nodes and edges. Instead, this information should be suitably extracted from the raw image data. Motivated by this, we present a principled model to extract network topologies from images that is scalable and efficient. We map this goal into solving a routing optimization problem where the solution is a network that minimizes an energy function which can be interpreted in terms of an operational and infrastructural cost. Our method relies on recent results from optimal transport theory and is a principled alternative to standard image-processing techniques that are based on heuristics. We test our model on real images of the retinal vascular system, slime mold and river networks and compare with routines combining image-processing techniques. Results are tested in terms of a similarity measure related to the amount of information preserved in the extraction. We find that our model finds networks from retina vascular network images that are more similar to hand-labeled ones, while also giving high performance in extracting networks from images of rivers and slime mold for which there is no ground truth available. While there is no unique method that fits all the images the best, our approach performs consistently across datasets, its algorithmic implementation is efficient and can be fully automatized to be run on several datasets with little supervision.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Discover and Mitigate Unknown Biases with Debiasing Alternate Networks\nAbstract: Deep image classifiers have been found to learn biases from datasets. To mitigate the biases, most previous methods require labels of protected attributes (e.g., age, skin tone) as full-supervision, which has two limitations: 1) it is infeasible when the labels are unavailable; 2) they are incapable of mitigating unknown biases -- biases that humans do not preconceive. To resolve those problems, we propose Debiasing Alternate Networks (DebiAN), which comprises two networks -- a Discoverer and a Classifier. By training in an alternate manner, the discoverer tries to find multiple unknown biases of the classifier without any annotations of biases, and the classifier aims at unlearning the biases identified by the discoverer. While previous works evaluate debiasing results in terms of a single bias, we create Multi-Color MNIST dataset to better benchmark mitigation of multiple biases in a multi-bias setting, which not only reveals the problems in previous methods but also demonstrates the advantage of DebiAN in identifying and mitigating multiple biases simultaneously. We further conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, showing that the discoverer in DebiAN can identify unknown biases that may be hard to be found by humans.

{"text": "Title: Phase field modelling of fracture and fatigue in Shape Memory Alloys\nAbstract: We present a new phase field framework for modelling fracture and fatigue in Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs). The constitutive model captures the superelastic behaviour of SMAs and damage is driven by the elastic and transformation strain energy densities. We consider both the assumption of a constant fracture energy and the case of a fracture energy dependent on the martensitic volume fraction. The framework is implemented in an implicit time integration scheme, with both monolithic and staggered solution strategies. The potential of this formulation is showcased by modelling a number of paradigmatic problems. First, a boundary layer model is used to examine crack tip fields and compute crack growth resistance curves (R-curves). We show that the model is able to capture the main fracture features associated with SMAs, including the toughening effect associated with stress-induced phase transformation. Insight is gained into the role of temperature, material strength, crack density function and fracture energy homogenisation.

{"text": "Title: Learning the 3D Fauna of the Web\nAbstract: Learning 3D models of all animals on the Earth requires massively scaling up existing solutions. With this ultimate goal in mind, we develop 3D-Fauna, an approach that learns a pan-category deformable 3D animal model for more than 100 animal species jointly. One crucial bottleneck of modeling animals is the limited availability of training data, which we overcome by simply learning from 2D Internet images. We show that prior category-specific attempts fail to generalize to rare species with limited training images. We address this challenge by introducing the Semantic Bank of Skinned Models (SBSM), which automatically discovers a small set of base animal shapes by combining geometric inductive priors with semantic knowledge implicitly captured by an off-the-shelf self-supervised feature extractor. To train such a model, we also contribute a new large-scale dataset of diverse animal species. At inference time, given a single image of any quadruped animal, our model reconstructs an articulated 3D mesh in a feed-forward fashion within seconds.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Discrete Time Markovian Agents Interacting Through a Potential\nAbstract: A discrete time stochastic model for a multiagent system given in terms of a large collection of interacting Markov chains is studied. The evolution of the interacting particles is described through a time inhomogeneous transition probability kernel that depends on the 'gradient' of the potential field. The particles, in turn, dynamically modify the potential field through their cumulative input. Interacting Markov processes of the above form have been suggested as models for active biological transport in response to external stimulus such as a chemical gradient. One of the basic mathematical challenges is to develop a general theory of stability for such interacting Markovian systems and for the corresponding nonlinear Markov processes that arise in the large agent limit. Such a theory would be key to a mathematical understanding of the interactive structure formation that results from the complex feedback between the agents and the potential field. It will also be a crucial ingredient in developing simulation schemes that are faithful to the underlying model over long periods of time. The goal of this work is to study qualitative properties of the above stochastic system as the number of particles (N) and the time parameter (n) approach infinity. In this regard asymptotic properties of a deterministic nonlinear dynamical system, that arises in the propagation of chaos limit of the stochastic model, play a key role. We show that under suitable conditions this dynamical system has a unique fixed point. This result allows us to study stability properties of the underlying stochastic model. We show that as N \\rightarrow \\infty, the stochastic system is well approximated by the dynamical system, uniformly over time. As a consequence, for an arbitrarily initialized system, as N\\rightarrow \\infty and n \\rightarrow \\infty, the potential field and the empirical measure of the interacting particles are shown to converge to the unique fixed point of the dynamical system. In general, simulation of such interacting Markovian systems is a computationally daunting task. We propose a particle based approximation for the dynamic potential field which allows for a numerically tractable simulation scheme. It is shown that this simulation scheme well approximates the true physical system, uniformly over an infinite time horizon.", "field": "math", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: DiffAttack: Evasion Attacks Against Diffusion-Based Adversarial Purification\nAbstract: Diffusion-based purification defenses leverage diffusion models to remove crafted perturbations of adversarial examples and achieve state-of-the-art robustness. Recent studies show that even advanced attacks cannot break such defenses effectively, since the purification process induces an extremely deep computational graph which poses the potential problem of gradient obfuscation, high memory cost, and unbounded randomness. In this paper, we propose a unified framework DiffAttack to perform effective and efficient attacks against diffusion-based purification defenses, including both DDPM and score-based approaches. In particular, we propose a deviated-reconstruction loss at intermediate diffusion steps to induce inaccurate density gradient estimation to tackle the problem of vanishing/exploding gradients. We also provide a segment-wise forwarding-backwarding algorithm, which leads to memory-efficient gradient backpropagation. We validate the attack effectiveness of DiffAttack compared with existing adaptive attacks on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. We show that DiffAttack decreases the robust accuracy of models compared with SOTA attacks by over 20% on CIFAR-10 under $\\ell_\\infty$ attack $(\\epsilon=8/255)$, and over 10% on ImageNet under $\\ell_\\infty$ attack $(\\epsilon=4/255)$.

For Carnot groups with horizontal Goursat distribution we show that their generalized sectional curvatures depend only on the Engel part of the distribution. This family of Carnot groups contains naturally the three-dimensional Heisenberg group, as well as the Engel group.

When dealing with complex networks, this leads to very long mathematical expressions which are usually computationally very expensive to calculate. In this paper, we provide a new expression to simplify the probability principle of inclusion-exclusion's formula for intersections of unions, which appear when calculating reliability on non series parallel network systems. This new expression has much less terms, which reduces enormously the computational cost. We also show that the general form of the probability principle of inclusion-exclusion's formula has double exponential complexity whereas the simplified form has only exponential complexity with a linear exponent.

Instead of cleaning the dataset prior to model training, the dataset is dynamically adjusted during the training process. By comparing the aggregated gradient of a batch of samples and an individual example gradient, our method dynamically decides whether a corresponding example is helpful for the model at this point or is counter-productive and should be left out for the current update.

Popular matchings are the relaxation of stable matchings: given a graph G=(V,E) with strict preferences on the neighbors of the nodes, a matching M is popular if there is no other matching M' such that the number of nodes preferring M' is more than those preferring M. This paper considers the popularity testing problem, when the task is to decide whether a given matching is popular or not. Previous algorithms applied reductions to maximum weight matchings. We give a new algorithm for testing popularity by reducing the problem to maximum matching testing, thus attaining a linear running time O(|E|). Linear programming-based characterization of popularity is often applied for proving the popularity of a certain matching.

Our method learns to predict the ratio (quotient) image between a source image and the target image with the desired lighting, allowing us to relight the image while maintaining the local facial details.

Studies in the past two decades have shown that palmprints have outstanding merits in uniqueness and permanence, and have high user acceptance.

{"text": "Title: A Decentralized Multiagent-Based Task Scheduling Framework for Handling Uncertain Events in Fog Computing\nAbstract: Fog computing has become an attractive research topic in recent years. As an extension of the cloud, fog computing provides computing resources for Internet of Things (IoT) applications through communicative fog nodes located at the network edge. Fog nodes assist cloud services in handling real-time and mobile applications by bringing the processing capability to where the data is generated. However, the introduction of fog nodes can increase scheduling openness and uncertainty. The scheduling issues in fog computing need to consider the geography, load balancing, and network latency between IoT devices, fog nodes, as well as the parent cloud. Besides, the scheduling methods also need to deal with the occurrence of uncertain events in real-time so as to ensure service reliability. This paper proposes an agent-based framework with a decentralized structure to construct the architecture of fog computing, while three agent-based algorithms are proposed to implement the scheduling, load balance, and rescheduling processes. The proposed framework is implemented by JADE and evaluated on the iFogSim toolkit. Experimental results show that the proposed scheduling framework can adaptively schedule tasks and resources for different service requests in fog computing and can also improve the task success rate when uncertain events occur.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Search Games with Predictions\nAbstract: We study search games between a mobile Searcher and an immobile Hider in which the Searcher aims to minimize some payoff, which is either the time to find the Hider (the search time), or a normalized search time. We consider a new setting in which the Searcher has some potentially erroneous information, or prediction on the Hider's position. Specifically, we study tradeoffs between the consistency of a search strategy (i.e., its worst case expected payoff assuming the prediction is correct) and the robustness (i.e., the worst case expected payoff assuming that the prediction is adversarially generated). We show how to apply this framework in search games over both discrete and continuous, as well as bounded and unbounded spaces. Specifically, we prove optimal consistency/robustness tradeoffs for three fundamental search games, namely searching in a number of discrete locations, expanding search in a tree network, and searching in the infinite line.

{"text": "Title: Improved uncertainty quantification for neural networks with Bayesian last layer\nAbstract: Uncertainty quantification is an important task in machine learning - a task in which standardneural networks (NNs) have traditionally not excelled. This can be a limitation for safety-critical applications, where uncertainty-aware methods like Gaussian processes or Bayesian linear regression are often preferred. Bayesian neural networks are an approach to address this limitation. They assume probability distributions for all parameters and yield distributed predictions. However, training and inference are typically intractable and approximations must be employed. A promising approximation is NNs with Bayesian last layer (BLL). They assume distributed weights only in the linear output layer and yield a normally distributed prediction. To approximate the intractable Bayesian neural network, point estimates of the distributed weights in all but the last layer should be obtained by maximizing the marginal likelihood. This has previously been challenging, as the marginal likelihood is expensive to evaluate in this setting. We present a reformulation of the log-marginal likelihood of a NN with BLL which allows for efficient training using backpropagation. Furthermore, we address the challenge of uncertainty quantification for extrapolation points. We provide a metric to quantify the degree of extrapolation and derive a method to improve the uncertainty quantification for these points. Our methods are derived for the multivariate case and demonstrated in a simulation study. In comparison to Bayesian linear regression with fixed features, and a Bayesian neural network trained with variational inference, our proposed method achieves the highest log-predictive density on test data.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

We propose a novel differentiable algorithm for synthesizing hard shadows based on ray tracing, which we incorporate into training our face relighting model.

However, the inherent limitations of traditional neural networks arise due to their relatively fixed network structures and activation functions. 1, The type of activation function is single and relatively fixed, which leads to poor \"unit representation ability\" of the network, and it is often used to solve simple problems with very complex networks; 2, the network structure is not adaptive, it is easy to cause network structure redundant or insufficient. To address the aforementioned issues, this study proposes a novel neural network called X-Net. By utilizing our designed Alternating Backpropagation mechanism, X-Net dynamically selects appropriate activation functions based on derivative information during training to enhance the network's representation capability for specific tasks. Simultaneously, it accurately adjusts the network structure at the neuron level to accommodate tasks of varying complexities and reduce computational costs. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the dual advantages of X-Net in terms of reducing model size and improving representation power. Specifically, in terms of the number of parameters, X-Net is only 3$\\%$ of baselines on average, and only 1.4$\\%$ under some tasks. In terms of representation ability, X-Net can achieve an average $R^2$=0.985 on the fitting task by only optimizing the activation function without introducing any parameters. Finally, we also tested the ability of X-Net to help scientific discovery on data from multiple disciplines such as society, energy, environment, and aerospace, and achieved concise and good results.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: A Kernel Framework to Quantify a Model's Local Predictive Uncertainty under Data Distributional Shifts\nAbstract: Traditional Bayesian approaches for model uncertainty quantification rely on notoriously difficult processes of marginalization over each network parameter to estimate its probability density function (PDF). Our hypothesis is that internal layer outputs of a trained neural network contain all of the information related to both its mapping function (quantified by its weights) as well as the input data distribution. We therefore propose a framework for predictive uncertainty quantification of a trained neural network that explicitly estimates the PDF of its raw prediction space (before activation), p(y'|x,w), which we refer to as the model PDF, in a Gaussian reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The Gaussian RKHS provides a localized density estimate of p(y'|x,w), which further enables us to utilize gradient based formulations of quantum physics to decompose the model PDF in terms of multiple local uncertainty moments that provide much greater resolution of the PDF than the central moments characterized by Bayesian methods. This provides the framework with a better ability to detect distributional shifts in test data away from the training data PDF learned by the model. We evaluate the framework against existing uncertainty quantification methods on benchmark datasets that have been corrupted using common perturbation techniques. The kernel framework is observed to provide model uncertainty estimates with much greater precision based on the ability to detect model prediction errors.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Matching of Users and Creators in Two-Sided Markets with Departures\nAbstract: Many online platforms of today, including social media sites, are two-sided markets bridging content creators and users. Most of the existing literature on platform recommendation algorithms largely focuses on user preferences and decisions, and does not simultaneously address creator incentives. We propose a model of content recommendation that explicitly focuses on the dynamics of user-content matching, with the novel property that both users and creators may leave the platform permanently if they do not experience sufficient engagement. In our model, each player decides to participate at each time step based on utilities derived from the current match: users based on alignment of the recommended content with their preferences, and creators based on their audience size. We show that a user-centric greedy algorithm that does not consider creator departures can result in arbitrarily poor total engagement, relative to an algorithm that maximizes total engagement while accounting for two-sided departures. Moreover, in stark contrast to the case where only users or only creators leave the platform, we prove that with two-sided departures, approximating maximum total engagement within any constant factor is NP-hard. We present two practical algorithms, one with performance guarantees under mild assumptions on user preferences, and another that tends to outperform algorithms that ignore two-sided departures in practice.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

The edge-weights are taken from a general Polish space, which also covers the case of decorated graphs. Here, graphs can be either directed or undirected.

{"text": "Title: A Geometry-Sensitive Approach for Photographic Style Classification\nAbstract: Photographs are characterized by different compositional attributes like the Rule of Thirds, depth of field, vanishing-lines etc. The presence or absence of one or more of these attributes contributes to the overall artistic value of an image. In this work, we analyze the ability of deep learning based methods to learn such photographic style attributes. We observe that although a standard CNN learns the texture and appearance based features reasonably well, its understanding of global and geometric features is limited by two factors. First, the data-augmentation strategies (cropping, warping, etc.) distort the composition of a photograph and affect the performance. Secondly, the CNN features, in principle, are translation-invariant and appearance-dependent. But some geometric properties important for aesthetics, e.g. the Rule of Thirds (RoT), are position-dependent and appearance-invariant. Therefore, we propose a novel input representation which is geometry-sensitive, position-cognizant and appearance-invariant. We further introduce a two-column CNN architecture that performs better than the state-of-the-art (SoA) in photographic style classification. From our results, we observe that the proposed network learns both the geometric and appearance-based attributes better than the SoA.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

Recent studies show that models obtained under MM may produce inconsistent predictions for the same input. When this occurs, it becomes challenging to provide counterfactual explanations (CEs), a common means for offering recourse recommendations to individuals negatively affected by models' predictions. In this paper, we formalise this problem, which we name recourse-aware ensembling, and identify several desirable properties which methods for solving it should satisfy. We show that existing ensembling methods, naturally extended in different ways to provide CEs, fail to satisfy these properties. We then introduce argumentative ensembling, deploying computational argumentation to guarantee robustness of CEs to MM, while also accommodating customisable user preferences.

{"text": "Title: High-Fidelity Diffusion-based Image Editing\nAbstract: Diffusion models have attained remarkable success in the domains of image generation and editing. It is widely recognized that employing larger inversion and denoising steps in diffusion model leads to improved image reconstruction quality. However, the editing performance of diffusion models tends to be no more satisfactory even with increasing denoising steps. The deficiency in editing could be attributed to the conditional Markovian property of the editing process, where errors accumulate throughout denoising steps. To tackle this challenge, we first propose an innovative framework where a rectifier module is incorporated to modulate diffusion model weights with residual features, thereby providing compensatory information to bridge the fidelity gap. Furthermore, we introduce a novel learning paradigm aimed at minimizing error propagation during the editing process, which trains the editing procedure in a manner similar to denoising score-matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework and training strategy achieve high-fidelity reconstruction and editing results across various levels of denoising steps, meanwhile exhibits exceptional performance in terms of both quantitative metric and qualitative assessments.

The first case leads to so-called ``blob models\" which have received some attention recently as a tool to approximate non-linear diffusion by particle systems. The hard-sphere model is similar to a classical model for congested crowd motion. We review well-posedness results for these models and discuss their relationship to classical continuum description of aggregation-diffusion phenomena in the limit $\\delta\\to0$: the classical nonlinear drift diffusion equation and its incompressible counterpart.

This work is motivated by a variety of design tasks in real-world engineering applications, where practitioners would replace their computationally intensive physical models (e.g., high-resolution fluid simulators) with fast-to-evaluate predictive machine learning models, so as to accelerate the engineering design processes. There are two major challenges in constructing such predictive models: (a) high-dimensional inputs (e.g., many independent design parameters) and (b) small training data, generated by running extremely time-consuming simulations. Thus, reducing the input dimension is critical to alleviate the over-fitting issue caused by data insufficiency. Existing methods, including sliced inverse regression and active subspace approaches, reduce the input dimension by learning a linear coordinate transformation; our main contribution is to extend the transformation approach to a nonlinear regime. Specifically, we exploit reversible networks (RevNets) to learn nonlinear level sets of a high-dimensional function and parameterize its level sets in low-dimensional spaces. A new loss function was designed to utilize samples of the target functions' gradient to encourage the transformed function to be sensitive to only a few transformed coordinates.

Our paper concerns stochastic processes and studies the characteristic function of the path signature of the stochastic process. In contrast to the expected signature, it determines the law on the random signatures without any regularity condition. The computation of the characteristic function of the random signature offers potential applications in stochastic analysis and machine learning, where the expected signature plays an important role. In this paper, we focus on a time-homogeneous It\\^o diffusion process, and adopt a PDE approach to derive the characteristic function of its signature defined at any fixed time horizon. A key ingredient of our approach is the introduction of the generalised-signature process. This lifting enables us to establish the Feynman-Kac-type theorem for the characteristic function of the generalised-signature process by following the martingale approach. Moreover, as an application of our results, we present a novel derivation of the joint characteristic function of Brownian motion coupled with the L\\'evy area, leveraging the structure theorem of anti-symmetric matrices.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Gaussian Process based Stochastic Model Predictive Control for Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control\nAbstract: Cooperative driving relies on communication among vehicles to create situational awareness. One application of cooperative driving is Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) that aims at enhancing highway transportation safety and capacity. Model-based communication (MBC) is a new paradigm with a flexible content structure for broadcasting joint vehicle-driver predictive behavioral models. The vehicle's complex dynamics and diverse driving behaviors add complexity to the modeling process. Gaussian process (GP) is a fully data-driven and non-parametric Bayesian modeling approach which can be used as a modeling component of MBC. The knowledge about the uncertainty is propagated through predictions by generating local GPs for vehicles and broadcasting their hyper-parameters as a model to the neighboring vehicles. In this research study, GP is used to model each vehicle's speed trajectory, which allows vehicles to access the future behavior of their preceding vehicle during communication loss and/or low-rate communication. Besides, to overcome the safety issues in a vehicle platoon, two operating modes for each vehicle are considered; free following and emergency braking. This paper presents a discrete hybrid stochastic model predictive control, which incorporates system modes as well as uncertainties captured by GP models. The proposed control design approach finds the optimal vehicle speed trajectory with the goal of achieving a safe and efficient platoon of vehicles with small inter-vehicle gap while reducing the reliance of the vehicles on a frequent communication. Simulation studies demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed controller considering the aforementioned communication paradigm with low-rate intermittent communication.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Speeding Up Distributed Machine Learning Using Codes\nAbstract: Codes are widely used in many engineering applications to offer robustness against noise. In large-scale systems there are several types of noise that can affect the performance of distributed machine learning algorithms -- straggler nodes, system failures, or communication bottlenecks -- but there has been little interaction cutting across codes, machine learning, and distributed systems. In this work, we provide theoretical insights on how coded solutions can achieve significant gains compared to uncoded ones. We focus on two of the most basic building blocks of distributed learning algorithms: matrix multiplication and data shuffling. For matrix multiplication, we use codes to alleviate the effect of stragglers, and show that if the number of homogeneous workers is $n$, and the runtime of each subtask has an exponential tail, coded computation can speed up distributed matrix multiplication by a factor of $\\log n$. For data shuffling, we use codes to reduce communication bottlenecks, exploiting the excess in storage. We show that when a constant fraction $\\alpha$ of the data matrix can be cached at each worker, and $n$ is the number of workers, \\emph{coded shuffling} reduces the communication cost by a factor of $(\\alpha + \\frac{1}{n})\\gamma(n)$ compared to uncoded shuffling, where $\\gamma(n)$ is the ratio of the cost of unicasting $n$ messages to $n$ users to multicasting a common message (of the same size) to $n$ users.

{"text": "Title: DGDNN: Decoupled Graph Diffusion Neural Network for Stock Movement Prediction\nAbstract: Forecasting future stock trends remains challenging for academia and industry due to stochastic inter-stock dynamics and hierarchical intra-stock dynamics influencing stock prices. In recent years, graph neural networks have achieved remarkable performance in this problem by formulating multiple stocks as graph-structured data. However, most of these approaches rely on artificially defined factors to construct static stock graphs, which fail to capture the intrinsic interdependencies between stocks that rapidly evolve. In addition, these methods often ignore the hierarchical features of the stocks and lose distinctive information within. In this work, we propose a novel graph learning approach implemented without expert knowledge to address these issues. First, our approach automatically constructs dynamic stock graphs by entropy-driven edge generation from a signal processing perspective. Then, we further learn task-optimal dependencies between stocks via a generalized graph diffusion process on constructed stock graphs. Last, a decoupled representation learning scheme is adopted to capture distinctive hierarchical intra-stock features. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines on real-world datasets. Moreover, the ablation study and sensitivity study further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in modeling the time-evolving inter-stock and intra-stock dynamics.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Robust Physics Informed Neural Networks\nAbstract: We introduce a Robust version of the Physics-Informed Neural Networks (RPINNs) to approximate the Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) solution. Standard Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN) takes into account the governing physical laws described by PDE during the learning process. The network is trained on a data set that consists of randomly selected points in the physical domain and its boundary. PINNs have been successfully applied to solve various problems described by PDEs with boundary conditions. The loss function in traditional PINNs is based on the strong residuals of the PDEs. This loss function in PINNs is generally not robust with respect to the true error. The loss function in PINNs can be far from the true error, which makes the training process more difficult. In particular, we do not know if the training process has already converged to the solution with the required accuracy. This is especially true if we do not know the exact solution, so we cannot estimate the true error during the training. This paper introduces a different way of defining the loss function. It incorporates the residual and the inverse of the Gram matrix, computed using the energy norm. We test our RPINN algorithm on two Laplace problems and one advection-diffusion problem in two spatial dimensions. We conclude that RPINN is a robust method. The proposed loss coincides well with the true error of the solution, as measured in the energy norm. Thus, we know if our training process goes well, and we know when to stop the training to obtain the neural network approximation of the solution of the PDE with the true error of required accuracy.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

We prove that our semantics is bisimilar to the \"standard\" semantics of PITPNs. This allows us to use the rewriting logic tool Maude, combined with SMT solving, to provide sound and complete formal analyses for PITPNs. We develop and implement a new general folding approach for symbolic reachability, so that Maude-with-SMT reachability analysis terminates whenever the parametric state-class graph of the PITPN is finite. Our work opens up the possibility of using the many formal analysis capabilities of Maude -- including full LTL model checking, analysis with user-defined analysis strategies, and even statistical model checking -- for such nets. We illustrate this by explaining how almost all formal analysis and parameter synthesis methods supported by the state-of-the-art PITPN tool Romeo can be performed using Maude with SMT.

Recent studies are mainly devoted to exploring various fusion strategies to integrate multi-modal information into a unified representation for all labels.

{"text": "Title: Learning to Generalize towards Unseen Domains via a Content-Aware Style Invariant Model for Disease Detection from Chest X-rays\nAbstract: Performance degradation due to distribution discrepancy is a longstanding challenge in intelligent imaging, particularly for chest X-rays (CXRs). Recent studies have demonstrated that CNNs are biased toward styles (e.g., uninformative textures) rather than content (e.g., shape), in stark contrast to the human vision system. Radiologists tend to learn visual cues from CXRs and thus perform well across multiple domains. Motivated by this, we employ the novel on-the-fly style randomization modules at both image (SRM-IL) and feature (SRM-FL) levels to create rich style perturbed features while keeping the content intact for robust cross-domain performance. Previous methods simulate unseen domains by constructing new styles via interpolation or swapping styles from existing data, limiting them to available source domains during training. However, SRM-IL samples the style statistics from the possible value range of a CXR image instead of the training data to achieve more diversified augmentations. Moreover, we utilize pixel-wise learnable parameters in the SRM-FL compared to pre-defined channel-wise mean and standard deviations as style embeddings for capturing more representative style features. Additionally, we leverage consistency regularizations on global semantic features and predictive distributions from with and without style-perturbed versions of the same CXR to tweak the model's sensitivity toward content markers for accurate predictions.

The strategy sets up generation objectives by grouping body joints of detailed skeletons in close semantic proximity together and then replacing each of such joint group with a single body-part node. Such an operation recursively abstracts a human pose to coarser and coarser skeletons at multiple granularity levels. With gradually increasing the abstraction level, human motion becomes more and more concise and stable, significantly benefiting the cross-modal motion synthesis task. The whole text-driven human motion synthesis problem is then divided into multiple abstraction levels and solved with a multi-stage generation framework with a cascaded latent diffusion model: an initial generator first generates the coarsest human motion guess from a given text description; then, a series of successive generators gradually enrich the motion details based on the textual description and the previous synthesized results. Notably, we further integrate GUESS with the proposed dynamic multi-condition fusion mechanism to dynamically balance the cooperative effects of the given textual condition and synthesized coarse motion prompt in different generation stages.

Commun., vol. 281, pp. 1468-1472, 2008]. However, most real signals, especially for baseband real signals, cannot be perfectly recovered from their generalized analytic signals. Therefore, in this paper, the conventional Hilbert transform (HT) and analytic signal associated with the LCT are concerned. To transform a real signal into the LCT of its HT, two integral transforms (i.e., the HT and LCT) are required. The goal of this paper is to simplify cascades of multiple integral transforms, which may be the HT, analytic signal, LCT or inverse LCT. The proposed transforms can reduce the complexity when realizing the relationships among the following six kinds of signals: a real signal, its HT and analytic signal, and the LCT of these three signals. Most importantly, all the proposed transforms are reversible and undistorted. Using the proposed transforms, several signal processing applications are discussed and show the advantages and flexibility over simply using the analytic signal or the LCT.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

For codimension $p\\leq 11$, we already showed that the pointwise structure of the second fundamental form of the submanifold aligns with the anticipated characteristics, assuming the validity of the conjecture. In this paper, we confirm the conjecture until codimension $p=6$, whereas for codimensions $7\\leq p\\leq 9$ it is also possible that the submanifold exhibits a complex ruled structure with rulings of a specific dimension. Moreover, we prove that the claim of the conjecture holds for codimensions $7\\leq p\\leq 11$ albeit subject to an additional assumption.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Compensating trajectory bias for unsupervised patient stratification using adversarial recurrent neural networks\nAbstract: Electronic healthcare records are an important source of information which can be used in patient stratification to discover novel disease phenotypes. However, they can be challenging to work with as data is often sparse and irregularly sampled. One approach to solve these limitations is learning dense embeddings that represent individual patient trajectories using a recurrent neural network autoencoder (RNN-AE). This process can be susceptible to unwanted data biases. We show that patient embeddings and clusters using previously proposed RNN-AE models might be impacted by a trajectory bias, meaning that results are dominated by the amount of data contained in each patients trajectory, instead of clinically relevant details. We investigate this bias on 2 datasets (from different hospitals) and 2 disease areas as well as using different parts of the patient trajectory. Our results using 2 previously published baseline methods indicate a particularly strong bias in case of an event-to-end trajectory. We present a method that can overcome this issue using an adversarial training scheme on top of a RNN-AE. Our results show that our approach can reduce the trajectory bias in all cases.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

In practice, we design a new integer sorting algorithm, \\textsf{DovetailSort}, that is theoretically-efficient and has good practical performance. In particular, \\textsf{DovetailSort} overcomes a common challenge in existing parallel integer sorting algorithms, which is the difficulty of detecting and taking advantage of duplicate keys.

{"text": "Title: Answering Queries with Negation over Existential Rules\nAbstract: Ontology-based query answering with existential rules is well understood and implemented for positive queries, in particular conjunctive queries. The situation changes drastically for queries with negation, where there is no agreed-upon semantics or standard implementation. Stratification, as used for Datalog, is not enough for existential rules, since the latter still admit multiple universal models that can differ on negative queries. We therefore propose universal core models as a basis for a meaningful (non-monotonic) semantics for queries with negation. Since cores are hard to compute, we identify syntactic descriptions of queries that can equivalently be answered over other types of models. This leads to fragments of queries with negation that can safely be evaluated by current chase implementations. We establish new techniques to estimate how the core model differs from other universal models, and we incorporate our findings into a new reasoning approach for existential rules with negation.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: How does Observational Learning Impact Crowdfunding Outcomes for Backers, Project Creators and Platforms?\nAbstract: Reward-based crowdfunding platforms are becoming increasingly popular to finance projects proposing innovative products, e.g., Kickstarter. One important challenge of this form of financing is the uncertainty in the quality of projects. To mitigate the negative effects of this uncertainty for backers, platforms share information regarding the decisions of earlier backers visiting the project campaign pages. This allows backers not only to rely on their expertise to identify project qualities but also to learn from the decisions of their fellow backers who might be more informed. Current studies on observational learning (OL) in crowdfunding mainly focus on predicting the success chances of projects, and there is a lack of understanding of how OL affects crowdfunding dynamics for backers, project creators and platforms. This paper aims to fill this gap by using a theoretical OL model involving two projects competing for funding from backers who may have differentiated expertness in identifying project quality. By introducing various performance measures for backers, creators and platforms and comparing these measures under OL to the case without learning, we provide a thorough analysis of how OL impacts crowdfunding outcomes. We find that information sharing and OL always benefit backers, especially when the early backers are experts. Regarding the impact of OL on creators and platforms, our analysis reveals two understudied but important aspects: the tightness of the competition for projects according to the availability of funding, and the quality difference among the proposed projects. Additionally, we investigate how OL affects the quality decisions of creators and show that OL increases the incentive for high-quality products, especially in situations where funding is scarce.", "field": "math", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: A Truthful Referral Auction Over Networks\nAbstract: This paper studies a mechanism design problem over a network, where agents can only participate by referrals. The Bulow-Klemberer theorem proposes that expanding the number of participants is a more effective approach to increase revenue than modifying the auction format. However, agents lack the motivation to invite others because doing so intensifies competition among them. On the other hand, misreporting social networks is also a common problem that can reduce revenue. Examples of misreporting include Sybil attacks (an agent pretending to be multiple bidders) and coalition groups (multiple agents pretending to be an agent). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel mechanism called the Truthful Referral Diffusion Mechanism (TRDM). TRDM incentivizes agents to report their social networks truthfully, and some of them are rewarded by the seller for improving revenue. In spite of the fact that some agents overbid in TRDM, the revenue is fixed, and it is higher than the revenue of any mechanism without referrals. TRDM is budget-balanced (non-negative revenue) and generates an efficient outcome (maximized social welfare), making it attractive for both the seller and the buyers as it improves revenue and reward.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Stochastic Coalitional Games for Cooperative Random Access in M2M Communications\nAbstract: In this paper, the problem of random access contention between machine type devices (MTDs) in the uplink of a wireless cellular network is studied. In particular, the possibility of forming cooperative groups to coordinate the MTDs' requests for the random access channel (RACH) is analyzed. The problem is formulated as a stochastic coalition formation game in which the MTDs are the players that seek to form cooperative coalitions to optimize a utility function that captures each MTD's energy consumption and time-varying queue length. Within each coalition, an MTD acts as a coalition head that sends the access requests of the coalition members over the RACH. One key feature of this game is its ability to cope with stochastic environments in which the arrival requests of MTDs and the packet success rate over RACH are dynamically time-varying. The proposed stochastic coalitional is composed of multiple stages, each of which corresponds to a coalitional game in stochastic characteristic form that is played by the MTDs at each time step. To solve this game, a novel distributed coalition formation algorithm is proposed and shown to converge to a stable MTD partition. Simulation results show that, on the average, the proposed stochastic coalition formation algorithm can reduce the average fail ratio and energy consumption of up to 36% and 31% for a cluster-based distribution of MTDs, respectively, compared with a noncooperative case. Moreover, when the MTDs are more sensitive to the energy consumption (queue length), the coalitions' size will increase (decrease).", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

More precisely, given a real analytic manifold $M$ and a subanalytic isotropic subset $\\Lambda$ of its co-sphere bundle $S^*M$, we show that the partially wrapped Fukaya category of $T^*M$ stopped at $\\Lambda$ is equivalent to the category of compact objects in the unbounded derived category of sheaves on $M$ with microsupport inside $\\Lambda$.

{"text": "Title: SGFormer: Simplifying and Empowering Transformers for Large-Graph Representations\nAbstract: Learning representations on large-sized graphs is a long-standing challenge due to the inter-dependence nature involved in massive data points. Transformers, as an emerging class of foundation encoders for graph-structured data, have shown promising performance on small graphs due to its global attention capable of capturing all-pair influence beyond neighboring nodes. Even so, existing approaches tend to inherit the spirit of Transformers in language and vision tasks, and embrace complicated models by stacking deep multi-head attentions. In this paper, we critically demonstrate that even using a one-layer attention can bring up surprisingly competitive performance across node property prediction benchmarks where node numbers range from thousand-level to billion-level. This encourages us to rethink the design philosophy for Transformers on large graphs, where the global attention is a computation overhead hindering the scalability. We frame the proposed scheme as Simplified Graph Transformers (SGFormer), which is empowered by a simple attention model that can efficiently propagate information among arbitrary nodes in one layer. SGFormer requires none of positional encodings, feature/graph pre-processing or augmented loss. Empirically, SGFormer successfully scales to the web-scale graph ogbn-papers100M and yields up to 141x inference acceleration over SOTA Transformers on medium-sized graphs.

{"text": "Title: Necessary and sufficient graphical conditions for optimal adjustment sets in causal graphical models with hidden variables\nAbstract: The problem of selecting optimal backdoor adjustment sets to estimate causal effects in graphical models with hidden and conditioned variables is addressed. Previous work has defined optimality as achieving the smallest asymptotic estimation variance and derived an optimal set for the case without hidden variables. For the case with hidden variables there can be settings where no optimal set exists and currently only a sufficient graphical optimality criterion of limited applicability has been derived. In the present work optimality is characterized as maximizing a certain adjustment information which allows to derive a necessary and sufficient graphical criterion for the existence of an optimal adjustment set and a definition and algorithm to construct it. Further, the optimal set is valid if and only if a valid adjustment set exists and has higher (or equal) adjustment information than the Adjust-set proposed in Perkovi{\\'c} et al. [Journal of Machine Learning Research, 18: 1--62, 2018] for any graph. The results translate to minimal asymptotic estimation variance for a class of estimators whose asymptotic variance follows a certain information-theoretic relation. Numerical experiments indicate that the asymptotic results also hold for relatively small sample sizes and that the optimal adjustment set or minimized variants thereof often yield better variance also beyond that estimator class. Surprisingly, among the randomly created setups more than 90\\% fulfill the optimality conditions indicating that also in many real-world scenarios graphical optimality may hold.

For unseen object categories, 2D open-vocabulary segmentation has achieved promising results that solely rely on frozen CLIP backbones and ensembling multiple classification outputs.

To improve our understanding of potential geometric mean definitions, we first study general $p$-means of convex bodies, with the usual definition extended to two series ranging over all $p \\in [-\\infty,\\infty]$. We characterize their equality cases and obtain (in almost all instances tight) inequalities that quantify how well these means approximate each other. As a corollary, we establish that every Minkowski centered body is equidistant from all its $p$-symmetrizations with respect to the Banach-Mazur distance.

{"text": "Title: The Effect of Learning Strategy versus Inherent Architecture Properties on the Ability of Convolutional Neural Networks to Develop Transformation Invariance\nAbstract: As object recognition becomes an increasingly common ML task, and recent research demonstrating CNNs vulnerability to attacks and small image perturbations necessitate fully understanding the foundations of object recognition. We focus on understanding the mechanisms behind how neural networks generalize to spatial transformations of complex objects. While humans excel at discriminating between objects shown at new positions, orientations, and scales, past results demonstrate that this may be limited to familiar objects - humans demonstrate low tolerance of spatial-variances for purposefully constructed novel objects. Because training artificial neural networks from scratch is similar to showing novel objects to humans, we seek to understand the factors influencing the tolerance of CNNs to spatial transformations. We conduct a thorough empirical examination of seven Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. By training on a controlled face image dataset, we measure model accuracy across different degrees of 5 transformations: position, size, rotation, Gaussian blur, and resolution transformation due to resampling. We also examine how learning strategy affects generalizability by examining how different amounts of pre-training have on model robustness. Overall, we find that the most significant contributor to transformation invariance is pre-training on a large, diverse image dataset. Moreover, while AlexNet tends to be the least robust network, VGG and ResNet architectures demonstrate higher robustness for different transformations. Along with kernel visualizations and qualitative analyses, we examine differences between learning strategy and inherent architectural properties in contributing to invariance of transformations, providing valuable information towards understanding how to achieve greater robustness to transformations in CNNs.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

Our investigation includes a review of the current state-of-the-art approaches, including recurrent GNNs, convolutional GNNs, graph autoencoders, and graph attention networks. A new burgeoning line of research is also discussed where graph reinforcement learning is being used to evaluate and improve the quality of graph summaries. Additionally, the survey provides details of benchmark datasets, evaluation metrics, and open-source tools that are often employed in experimentation settings, along with a detailed comparison, discussion, and takeaways for the research community focused on graph summarization. Finally, the survey concludes with a number of open research challenges to motivate further study in this area.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

The algorithm (like its predecessor version) bears elements which are closely related to early known methods for numerical inversion of the characteristic function of a probability distribution, however here efficiently computes the complete distribution function. Possible applications are in computing the distribution of the bootstrap estimate in any linear bootstrap method (e.g. in the block bootstrap for the mean as parameter of interest, or residual bootstrap in linear regression with fixed design), or in elementary analysis-of-variance hypothesis testing.", "field": "math", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Efficient Detection of Botnet Traffic by features selection and Decision Trees\nAbstract: Botnets are one of the online threats with the biggest presence, causing billionaire losses to global economies. Nowadays, the increasing number of devices connected to the Internet makes it necessary to analyze large amounts of network traffic data. In this work, we focus on increasing the performance on botnet traffic classification by selecting those features that further increase the detection rate. For this purpose we use two feature selection techniques, Information Gain and Gini Importance, which led to three pre-selected subsets of five, six and seven features. Then, we evaluate the three feature subsets along with three models, Decision Tree, Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors. To test the performance of the three feature vectors and the three models we generate two datasets based on the CTU-13 dataset, namely QB-CTU13 and EQB-CTU13. We measure the performance as the macro averaged F1 score over the computational time required to classify a sample. The results show that the highest performance is achieved by Decision Trees using a five feature set which obtained a mean F1 score of 85% classifying each sample in an average time of 0.78 microseconds.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: A dilation theoretic approach to approximation by inner functions\nAbstract: Using results from theory of operators on a Hilbert space, we prove approximation results for matrix-valued holomorphic functions on the unit disc and the unit bidisc. The essential tools are the theory of unitary dilation of a contraction and the realization formula for functions in the unit ball of $H^\\infty$. We first prove a generalization of a result of Carath\\'eodory. This generalization has many applications. A uniform approximation result for matrix-valued holomorphic functions which extend continuously to the unit circle is proved using the Potapov factorization. This generalizes a theorem due to Fisher. Approximation results are proved for matrix-valued functions for whom a naturally associated kernel has finitely many negative squares. This uses the Krein-Langer factorization. Approximation results for $J$-contractive meromorphic functions where $J$ induces an indefinite metric on $\\mathbb C^N$ are proved using the Potapov-Ginzburg Theorem.

If a partial differential operator is of splitting rank $2$, such as the operator associated with Poisson or Helmholtz, the corresponding PDE is solved via a generalized Sylvester matrix equation, and a bivariate polynomial approximation of the solution of degree $(n_x,n_y)$ is computed in $\\mathcal{O}((n_x n_y)^{3/2})$ operations.

{"text": "Title: View-based Explanations for Graph Neural Networks\nAbstract: Generating explanations for graph neural networks (GNNs) has been studied to understand their behavior in analytical tasks such as graph classification. Existing approaches aim to understand the overall results of GNNs rather than providing explanations for specific class labels of interest, and may return explanation structures that are hard to access, nor directly queryable. We propose GVEX, a novel paradigm that generates Graph Views for EXplanation. (1) We design a two-tier explanation structure called explanation views. An explanation view consists of a set of graph patterns and a set of induced explanation subgraphs. Given a database G of multiple graphs and a specific class label l assigned by a GNN-based classifier M, it concisely describes the fraction of G that best explains why l is assigned by M. (2) We propose quality measures and formulate an optimization problem to compute optimal explanation views for GNN explanation. We show that the problem is $\\Sigma^2_P$-hard. (3) We present two algorithms. The first one follows an explain-and-summarize strategy that first generates high-quality explanation subgraphs which best explain GNNs in terms of feature influence maximization, and then performs a summarization step to generate patterns. We show that this strategy provides an approximation ratio of 1/2. Our second algorithm performs a single-pass to an input node stream in batches to incrementally maintain explanation views, having an anytime quality guarantee of 1/4 approximation. Using real-world benchmark data, we experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of GVEX.

{"text": "Title: On Augmenting Scenario-Based Modeling with Generative AI\nAbstract: The manual modeling of complex systems is a daunting task; and although a plethora of methods exist that mitigate this issue, the problem remains very difficult. Recent advances in generative AI have allowed the creation of general-purpose chatbots, capable of assisting software engineers in various modeling tasks. However, these chatbots are often inaccurate, and an unstructured use thereof could result in erroneous system models. In this paper, we outline a method for the safer and more structured use of chatbots as part of the modeling process. To streamline this integration, we propose leveraging scenario-based modeling techniques, which are known to facilitate the automated analysis of models.

{"text": "Title: Image classification and retrieval with random depthwise signed convolutional neural networks\nAbstract: We propose a random convolutional neural network to generate a feature space in which we study image classification and retrieval performance. Put briefly we apply random convolutional blocks followed by global average pooling to generate a new feature, and we repeat this k times to produce a k-dimensional feature space. This can be interpreted as partitioning the space of image patches with random hyperplanes which we formalize as a random depthwise convolutional neural network. In the network's final layer we perform image classification and retrieval with the linear support vector machine and k-nearest neighbor classifiers and study other empirical properties. We show that the ratio of image pixel distribution similarity across classes to within classes is higher in our network's final layer compared to the input space. When we apply the linear support vector machine for image classification we see that the accuracy is higher than if we were to train just the final layer of VGG16, ResNet18, and DenseNet40 with random weights. In the same setting we compare it to an unsupervised feature learning method and find our accuracy to be comparable on CIFAR10 but higher on CIFAR100 and STL10. We see that the accuracy is not far behind that of trained networks, particularly in the top-k setting. For example the top-2 accuracy of our network is near 90% on both CIFAR10 and a 10-class mini ImageNet, and 85% on STL10. We find that k-nearest neighbor gives a comparable precision on the Corel Princeton Image Similarity Benchmark than if we were to use the final layer of trained networks. As with other networks we find that our network fails to a black box attack even though we lack a gradient and use the sign activation. We highlight sensitivity of our network to background as a potential pitfall and an advantage.

Even with today's powerful computers, numerical simulations of such systems are prohibitively expensive. We propose an approach for the simulation of dynamical systems governed by functions of adjacency matrices in high dimension, by random projections via Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings, and recovery by compressed sensing techniques.

{"text": "Title: Offline Policy Optimization with Eligible Actions\nAbstract: Offline policy optimization could have a large impact on many real-world decision-making problems, as online learning may be infeasible in many applications. Importance sampling and its variants are a commonly used type of estimator in offline policy evaluation, and such estimators typically do not require assumptions on the properties and representational capabilities of value function or decision process model function classes. In this paper, we identify an important overfitting phenomenon in optimizing the importance weighted return, in which it may be possible for the learned policy to essentially avoid making aligned decisions for part of the initial state space. We propose an algorithm to avoid this overfitting through a new per-state-neighborhood normalization constraint, and provide a theoretical justification of the proposed algorithm. We also show the limitations of previous attempts to this approach. We test our algorithm in a healthcare-inspired simulator, a logged dataset collected from real hospitals and continuous control tasks.

{"text": "Title: Efficient UAVs Deployment and Resource Allocation in UAV-Relay Assisted Public Safety Networks for Video Transmission\nAbstract: Wireless communication highly depends on the cellular ground base station (GBS). A failure of the cellular GBS, fully or partially, during natural or man-made disasters creates a communication gap in the disaster-affected areas. In such situations, public safety communication (PSC) can significantly save the national infrastructure, property, and lives. Throughout emergencies, the PSC can provide mission-critical communication and video transmission services in the affected area. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying base stations (UAV-BSs) are particularly suitable for PSC services as they are flexible, mobile, and easily deployable. This manuscript considers a multi-UAV-assisted PSC network with an observational UAV receiving videos from the affected area's ground users (AGUs) and transmitting them to the nearby GBS via a relay UAV. The objective of the proposed study is to maximize the average utility of the video streams generated by the AGUs upon reaching the GBS. This is achieved by optimizing the positions of the observational and relay UAVs, as well as the distribution of communication resources, such as bandwidth, and transmit power, while satisfying the system-designed constraints, such as transmission rate, rate outage probability, transmit power budget, and available bandwidth. To this end, a joint UAVs placement and resource allocation problem is mathematically formulated. The proposed problem poses a significant challenge for a solution.

We introduce Unicron, a workload manager designed for efficient self-healing in large-scale language model training. Unicron optimizes the training process by minimizing failure-related costs across multiple concurrent tasks within a cluster. Its key features include in-band error detection for real-time error identification without extra overhead, a dynamic cost-aware plan generation mechanism for optimal reconfiguration, and an efficient transition strategy to reduce downtime during state changes.

{"text": "Title: Byzantine-Resilient Gradient Coding through Local Gradient Computations\nAbstract: We consider gradient coding in the presence of an adversary controlling so-called malicious workers trying to corrupt the computations. Previous works propose the use of MDS codes to treat the responses from malicious workers as errors and correct them using the error-correction properties of the code. This comes at the expense of increasing the replication, i.e., the number of workers each partial gradient is computed by. In this work, we propose a way to reduce the replication to $s+1$ instead of $2s+1$ in the presence of $s$ malicious workers. Our method detects erroneous inputs from the malicious workers, transforming them into erasures. This comes at the expense of $s$ additional local computations at the main node and additional rounds of light communication between the main node and the workers. We define a general framework and give fundamental limits for fractional repetition data allocations. Our scheme is optimal in terms of replication and local computation and incurs a communication cost that is asymptotically, in the size of the dataset, a multiplicative factor away from the derived bound. We furthermore show how additional redundancy can be exploited to reduce the number of local computations and communication cost, or, alternatively, tolerate straggling workers.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

Contrastive Captioners (CoCa), as a representative method, integrates Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) and Image Caption (IC) into a unified framework, resulting in impressive results. CLIP imposes a bidirectional constraints on global representation of entire images and sentences. Although IC conducts an unidirectional image-to-text generation on local representation, it lacks any constraint on local text-to-image reconstruction, which limits the ability to understand images at a fine-grained level when aligned with texts. To achieve multimodal alignment from both global and local perspectives, this paper proposes Symmetrizing Contrastive Captioners (SyCoCa), which introduces bidirectional interactions on images and texts across the global and local representation levels. Specifically, we expand a Text-Guided Masked Image Modeling (TG-MIM) head based on ITC and IC heads. The improved SyCoCa can further leverage textual cues to reconstruct contextual images and visual cues to predict textual contents. When implementing bidirectional local interactions, the local contents of images tend to be cluttered or unrelated to their textual descriptions. Thus, we employ an attentive masking strategy to select effective image patches for interaction.

A non-trivial crossover phenomenon takes place in the regime of weak resetting and late times. Remarkably, the time intervals between spontaneous returns to the origin of the reset random walk form a renewal process described in terms of a single `dressed' probability distribution.

{"text": "Title: Dataset Difficulty and the Role of Inductive Bias\nAbstract: Motivated by the goals of dataset pruning and defect identification, a growing body of methods have been developed to score individual examples within a dataset. These methods, which we call \"example difficulty scores\", are typically used to rank or categorize examples, but the consistency of rankings between different training runs, scoring methods, and model architectures is generally unknown. To determine how example rankings vary due to these random and controlled effects, we systematically compare different formulations of scores over a range of runs and model architectures. We find that scores largely share the following traits: they are noisy over individual runs of a model, strongly correlated with a single notion of difficulty, and reveal examples that range from being highly sensitive to insensitive to the inductive biases of certain model architectures. Drawing from statistical genetics, we develop a simple method for fingerprinting model architectures using a few sensitive examples. These findings guide practitioners in maximizing the consistency of their scores (e.g. by choosing appropriate scoring methods, number of runs, and subsets of examples), and establishes comprehensive baselines for evaluating scores in the future.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Efficient Algorithms for Learning from Coarse Labels\nAbstract: For many learning problems one may not have access to fine grained label information; e.g., an image can be labeled as husky, dog, or even animal depending on the expertise of the annotator. In this work, we formalize these settings and study the problem of learning from such coarse data. Instead of observing the actual labels from a set $\\mathcal{Z}$, we observe coarse labels corresponding to a partition of $\\mathcal{Z}$ (or a mixture of partitions). Our main algorithmic result is that essentially any problem learnable from fine grained labels can also be learned efficiently when the coarse data are sufficiently informative. We obtain our result through a generic reduction for answering Statistical Queries (SQ) over fine grained labels given only coarse labels. The number of coarse labels required depends polynomially on the information distortion due to coarsening and the number of fine labels $|\\mathcal{Z}|$. We also investigate the case of (infinitely many) real valued labels focusing on a central problem in censored and truncated statistics: Gaussian mean estimation from coarse data.

However, their unique combination of graphical elements (e.g., bars, lines) and textual components (e.g., labels, legends) poses challenges for general-purpose multimodal models. While vision-language models trained on chart data excel in comprehension, they struggle with generalization and require task-specific fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose ChartAssistant, a chart-based vision-language model for universal chart comprehension and reasoning. ChartAssistant leverages ChartSFT, a comprehensive dataset covering diverse chart-related tasks with basic and specialized chart types. It undergoes a two-stage training process, starting with pre-training on chart-to-table parsing to align chart and text, followed by multitask instruction-following fine-tuning. This approach enables ChartAssistant to achieve competitive performance across various chart tasks without task-specific fine-tuning.

{"text": "Title: On Codes for the Noisy Substring Channel\nAbstract: We consider the problem of coding for the substring channel, in which information strings are observed only through their (multisets of) substrings. Due to existing DNA sequencing techniques and applications in DNA-based storage systems, interest in this channel has renewed in recent years. In contrast to existing literature, we consider a noisy channel model where information is subject to noise before its substrings are sampled, motivated by in-vivo storage. We study two separate noise models, substitutions or deletions. In both cases, we examine families of codes which may be utilized for error-correction and present combinatorial bounds on their sizes. Through a generalization of the concept of repeat-free strings, we show that the added required redundancy due to this imperfect observation assumption is sublinear, either when the fraction of errors in the observed substring length is sufficiently small, or when that length is sufficiently long. This suggests that no asymptotic cost in rate is incurred by this channel model in these cases. Moreover, we develop an efficient encoder for such constrained strings in some cases. Finally, we show how a similar encoder can be used to avoid formation of secondary-structures in coded DNA strands, even when accounting for imperfect structures.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

In this context we seek to quantify fluctuations from the asymptotics for point counts. We obtain uniform upper bounds on the discrepancy depending on the diophantine properties of the lattice as well as universal lower bounds on the average of the discrepancy. In an appendix, Michael Bj\\\"orklund and Tobias Hartnick obtain lower bounds on the $L^2$-norm of the discrepancy also depending on the diophantine class; these lower bounds match our uniform upper bounds and both are therefore sharp.

To address this issue, we introduce a dense depth map as a geometry guide to mitigate overfitting. We obtained the depth map using a pre-trained monocular depth estimation model and aligning the scale and offset using sparse COLMAP feature points. The adjusted depth aids in the color-based optimization of 3D Gaussian splatting, mitigating floating artifacts, and ensuring adherence to geometric constraints.

{"text": "Title: Minimum Coverage Sets for Training Robust Ad Hoc Teamwork Agents\nAbstract: Robustly cooperating with unseen agents and human partners presents significant challenges due to the diverse cooperative conventions these partners may adopt. Existing Ad Hoc Teamwork (AHT) methods address this challenge by training an agent with a population of diverse teammate policies obtained through maximizing specific diversity metrics. However, prior heuristic-based diversity metrics do not always maximize the agent's robustness in all cooperative problems. In this work, we first propose that maximizing an AHT agent's robustness requires it to emulate policies in the minimum coverage set (MCS), the set of best-response policies to any partner policies in the environment. We then introduce the L-BRDiv algorithm that generates a set of teammate policies that, when used for AHT training, encourage agents to emulate policies from the MCS. L-BRDiv works by solving a constrained optimization problem to jointly train teammate policies for AHT training and approximating AHT agent policies that are members of the MCS. We empirically demonstrate that L-BRDiv produces more robust AHT agents than state-of-the-art methods in a broader range of two-player cooperative problems without the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning for its objectives.

{"text": "Title: Preserving Image Properties Through Initializations in Diffusion Models\nAbstract: Retail photography imposes specific requirements on images. For instance, images may need uniform background colors, consistent model poses, centered products, and consistent lighting. Minor deviations from these standards impact a site's aesthetic appeal, making the images unsuitable for use. We show that Stable Diffusion methods, as currently applied, do not respect these requirements. The usual practice of training the denoiser with a very noisy image and starting inference with a sample of pure noise leads to inconsistent generated images during inference. This inconsistency occurs because it is easy to tell the difference between samples of the training and inference distributions. As a result, a network trained with centered retail product images with uniform backgrounds generates images with erratic backgrounds. The problem is easily fixed by initializing inference with samples from an approximation of noisy images. However, in using such an approximation, the joint distribution of text and noisy image at inference time still slightly differs from that at training time. This discrepancy is corrected by training the network with samples from the approximate noisy image distribution. Extensive experiments on real application data show significant qualitative and quantitative improvements in performance from adopting these procedures.

A proportional $L$-coloring of $G$ is a proper $L$-coloring in which each color $c \\in \\bigcup_{v \\in V(G)} L(v)$ is used $\\lfloor \\eta(c)/k \\rfloor$ or $\\lceil \\eta(c)/k \\rceil$ times where $\\eta(c)=\\left\\lvert{\\{v \\in V(G) : c \\in L(v) \\}}\\right\\rvert$.

A very special interesting case of this is the \"Divide and Color Model\" (which motivates the name we use) introduced and studied by Olle H\\\"aggstr\\\"om. In this generalized model, one starts with a finite or countable set $V$, a random partition of $V$ and a parameter $p\\in [0,1]$. The corresponding Generalized Divide and Color Model is the $\\{0,1\\}$-valued process indexed by $V$ obtained by independently, for each partition element in the random partition chosen, with probability $p$, assigning all the elements of the partition element the value 1, and with probability $1-p$, assigning all the elements of the partition element the value 0. Some of the questions which we study here are the following. Under what situations can different random partitions give rise to the same color process? What can one say concerning exchangeable random partitions? What is the set of product measures that a color process stochastically dominates? For random partitions which are translation invariant, what ergodic properties do the resulting color processes have? The motivation for studying these processes is twofold; on the one hand, we believe that this is a very natural and interesting class of processes that deserves investigation and on the other hand, a number of quite varied well-studied processes actually fall into this class such as (1) the Ising model, (2) the fuzzy Potts model, (3) the stationary distributions for the Voter Model, (4) random walk in random scenery and of course (5) the original Divide and Color Model.", "field": "math", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Few-shot Adaptation of Multi-modal Foundation Models: A Survey\nAbstract: Multi-modal (vision-language) models, such as CLIP, are replacing traditional supervised pre-training models (e.g., ImageNet-based pre-training) as the new generation of visual foundation models. These models with robust and aligned semantic representations learned from billions of internet image-text pairs and can be applied to various downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner. However, in some fine-grained domains like medical imaging and remote sensing, the performance of multi-modal foundation models often leaves much to be desired. Consequently, many researchers have begun to explore few-shot adaptation methods for these models, gradually deriving three main technical approaches: 1) prompt-based methods, 2) adapter-based methods, and 3) external knowledge-based methods. Nevertheless, this rapidly developing field has produced numerous results without a comprehensive survey to systematically organize the research progress. Therefore, in this survey, we introduce and analyze the research advancements in few-shot adaptation methods for multi-modal models, summarizing commonly used datasets and experimental setups, and comparing the results of different methods. In addition, due to the lack of reliable theoretical support for existing methods, we derive the few-shot adaptation generalization error bound for multi-modal models. The theorem reveals that the generalization error of multi-modal foundation models is constrained by three factors: domain gap, model capacity, and sample size. Based on this, we propose three possible solutions from the following aspects: 1) adaptive domain generalization, 2) adaptive model selection, and 3) adaptive knowledge utilization.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

Higher area deprivation correlated with polled vaccine hesitancy and lower search interest in vaccine interest, intention to vaccinate or concern about safety of vaccination. Positive correlations between ADI and certain mental health search trends were noted. No clear correlation between deprivation index and accessibility to vaccination sites were observed.

In recent years, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown considerable results in forming stable representations and generating realistic data. While many applications focus on generating image data, less effort has been made in generating time series data, especially multivariate signals. In this work, a Transformer-based autoencoder is proposed that is regularized using an adversarial training scheme to generate artificial multivariate time series signals.

It has been shown that Determinantal Point Process (DPP) based node pruning method is notably superior to competing approaches when tested on real datasets. Using GE bounds in the aforementioned setup we provide theoretical guarantees for their empirical observations. Another consistent finding in literature is that sparse neural networks (edge pruned) generalize better than dense neural networks (node pruned) for a fixed number of parameters. We use our theoretical setup to prove this finding and show that even the baseline random edge pruning method performs better than the DPP node pruning method. We also validate this empirically on real datasets.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

Specifically, we employ a multi-sector BD-RIS modeled as a prism, which can achieve highly directional full-space coverage, in a multiuser multiple input single output communication system. With the multi-sector BD-RIS aided RSMA model, we jointly design the transmit precoder and BD-RIS matrix under the imperfect channel state information (CSI) conditions. The robust design is performed by solving a stochastic average sum-rate maximization problem. With sample average approximation and weighted minimum mean square error-rate relationship, the stochastic problem is transformed into a deterministic one with multiple blocks, each of which is iteratively designed.

{"text": "Title: MedSumm: A Multimodal Approach to Summarizing Code-Mixed Hindi-English Clinical Queries\nAbstract: In the healthcare domain, summarizing medical questions posed by patients is critical for improving doctor-patient interactions and medical decision-making. Although medical data has grown in complexity and quantity, the current body of research in this domain has primarily concentrated on text-based methods, overlooking the integration of visual cues. Also prior works in the area of medical question summarisation have been limited to the English language. This work introduces the task of multimodal medical question summarization for codemixed input in a low-resource setting. To address this gap, we introduce the Multimodal Medical Codemixed Question Summarization MMCQS dataset, which combines Hindi-English codemixed medical queries with visual aids. This integration enriches the representation of a patient's medical condition, providing a more comprehensive perspective. We also propose a framework named MedSumm that leverages the power of LLMs and VLMs for this task. By utilizing our MMCQS dataset, we demonstrate the value of integrating visual information from images to improve the creation of medically detailed summaries.

{"text": "Title: The Case for Bayesian Deep Learning\nAbstract: The key distinguishing property of a Bayesian approach is marginalization instead of optimization, not the prior, or Bayes rule. Bayesian inference is especially compelling for deep neural networks. (1) Neural networks are typically underspecified by the data, and can represent many different but high performing models corresponding to different settings of parameters, which is exactly when marginalization will make the biggest difference for both calibration and accuracy. (2) Deep ensembles have been mistaken as competing approaches to Bayesian methods, but can be seen as approximate Bayesian marginalization. (3) The structure of neural networks gives rise to a structured prior in function space, which reflects the inductive biases of neural networks that help them generalize. (4) The observed correlation between parameters in flat regions of the loss and a diversity of solutions that provide good generalization is further conducive to Bayesian marginalization, as flat regions occupy a large volume in a high dimensional space, and each different solution will make a good contribution to a Bayesian model average.

{"text": "Title: Predictive Multiplicity in Probabilistic Classification\nAbstract: Machine learning models are often used to inform real world risk assessment tasks: predicting consumer default risk, predicting whether a person suffers from a serious illness, or predicting a person's risk to appear in court. Given multiple models that perform almost equally well for a prediction task, to what extent do predictions vary across these models? If predictions are relatively consistent for similar models, then the standard approach of choosing the model that optimizes a penalized loss suffices. But what if predictions vary significantly for similar models? In machine learning, this is referred to as predictive multiplicity i.e. the prevalence of conflicting predictions assigned by near-optimal competing models. In this paper, we present a framework for measuring predictive multiplicity in probabilistic classification (predicting the probability of a positive outcome). We introduce measures that capture the variation in risk estimates over the set of competing models, and develop optimization-based methods to compute these measures efficiently and reliably for convex empirical risk minimization problems. We demonstrate the incidence and prevalence of predictive multiplicity in real-world tasks. Further, we provide insight into how predictive multiplicity arises by analyzing the relationship between predictive multiplicity and data set characteristics (outliers, separability, and majority-minority structure).

However, there is still little work on the huge carbon footprint that has training DL models. This study aims to analyze the impact of the model architecture and training environment when training greener computer vision models. We divide this goal into two research questions. First, we analyze the effects of model architecture on achieving greener models while keeping correctness at optimal levels. Second, we study the influence of the training environment on producing greener models. To investigate these relationships, we collect multiple metrics related to energy efficiency and model correctness during the models' training. Then, we outline the trade-offs between the measured energy efficiency and the models' correctness regarding model architecture, and their relationship with the training environment. We conduct this research in the context of a computer vision system for image classification. In conclusion, we show that selecting the proper model architecture and training environment can reduce energy consumption dramatically (up to 81.38%) at the cost of negligible decreases in correctness.

Similar equations manifest in diverse applications like chemical diffusion, electrostatics, and Darcy flow. The neural network aims to establish the link between the complex thermal conductivity profiles and temperature distributions, as well as heat flux components within the microstructure, under fixed boundary conditions. A distinctive aspect is our independence from classical solvers like finite element methods for data. A noteworthy contribution lies in our novel approach to defining the loss function, based on the discretized weak form of the governing equation. This not only reduces the required order of derivatives but also eliminates the need for automatic differentiation in the construction of loss terms, accepting potential numerical errors from the chosen discretization method. As a result, the loss function in this work is an algebraic equation that significantly enhances training efficiency.

{"text": "Title: Estimation of statistics of transitions and Hill relation for Langevin dynamics\nAbstract: In molecular dynamics, statistics of transitions, such as the mean transition time, are macroscopic observables which provide important dynamical information on the underlying microscopic stochastic process. A direct estimation using simulations of microscopic trajectories over long time scales is typically computationally intractable in metastable situations. To overcome this issue, several numerical methods rely on a potential-theoretic identity, sometimes attributed to Hill in the computational statistical physics litterature, which expresses statistics of transitions in terms of the invariant measure of the sequence of configurations by which the underlying process enters metastable sets. The use of this identity then allows to replace the long time simulation problem with a rare event sampling problem, for which efficient algorithms are available. In this article, we rigorously analyse such a method for molecular systems modelled by the Langevin dynamics. Our main contributions are twofold. First, we prove the Hill relation in the fairly general context of positive Harris recurrent chains, and show that this formula applies to the Langevin dynamics. Second, we provide an explicit expression of the invariant measure involved in the Hill relation, and describe an elementary exact simulation procedure. Overall, this yields a simple and complete numerical method to estimate statistics of transitions.", "field": "math", "label": 1}

Subsequently, in the second stage, a separate surrogate model, functioning as an \"evaluator,\" is employed to assess the reduced candidate space generated in the first stage. This evaluation process eliminates inaccurate and uncertain solutions, guided by a user-defined coverage level. The framework's distinctive contribution is the integration of conformal inference, providing a versatile and efficient approach that can be widely applicable.

{"text": "Title: The relation between Granger causality and directed information theory: a review\nAbstract: This report reviews the conceptual and theoretical links between Granger causality and directed information theory. We begin with a short historical tour of Granger causality, concentrating on its closeness to information theory. The definitions of Granger causality based on prediction are recalled, and the importance of the observation set is discussed. We present the definitions based on conditional independence. The notion of instantaneous coupling is included in the definitions. The concept of Granger causality graphs is discussed. We present directed information theory from the perspective of studies of causal influences between stochastic processes. Causal conditioning appears to be the cornerstone for the relation between information theory and Granger causality. In the bivariate case, the fundamental measure is the directed information, which decomposes as the sum of the transfer entropies and a term quantifying instantaneous coupling. We show the decomposition of the mutual information into the sums of the transfer entropies and the instantaneous coupling measure, a relation known for the linear Gaussian case.

{"text": "Title: Location Aware Modular Biencoder for Tourism Question Answering\nAbstract: Answering real-world tourism questions that seek Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendations is challenging, as it requires both spatial and non-spatial reasoning, over a large candidate pool. The traditional method of encoding each pair of question and POI becomes inefficient when the number of candidates increases, making it infeasible for real-world applications. To overcome this, we propose treating the QA task as a dense vector retrieval problem, where we encode questions and POIs separately and retrieve the most relevant POIs for a question by utilizing embedding space similarity. We use pretrained language models (PLMs) to encode textual information, and train a location encoder to capture spatial information of POIs. Experiments on a real-world tourism QA dataset demonstrate that our approach is effective, efficient, and outperforms previous methods across all metrics. Enabled by the dense retrieval architecture, we further build a global evaluation baseline, expanding the search space by 20 times compared to previous work. We also explore several factors that impact on the model's performance through follow-up experiments.

{"text": "Title: Brain-Conditional Multimodal Synthesis: A Survey and Taxonomy\nAbstract: In the era of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), conditional multimodal synthesis technologies (e.g., text-to-image, text-to-video, text-to-audio, etc) are gradually reshaping the natural content in the real world. The key to multimodal synthesis technology is to establish the mapping relationship between different modalities. Brain signals, serving as potential reflections of how the brain interprets external information, exhibit a distinctive One-to-Many correspondence with various external modalities. This correspondence makes brain signals emerge as a promising guiding condition for multimodal content synthesis. Brian-conditional multimodal synthesis refers to decoding brain signals back to perceptual experience, which is crucial for developing practical brain-computer interface systems and unraveling complex mechanisms underlying how the brain perceives and comprehends external stimuli. This survey comprehensively examines the emerging field of AIGC-based Brain-conditional Multimodal Synthesis, termed AIGC-Brain, to delineate the current landscape and future directions. To begin, related brain neuroimaging datasets, functional brain regions, and mainstream generative models are introduced as the foundation of AIGC-Brain decoding and analysis. Next, we provide a comprehensive taxonomy for AIGC-Brain decoding models and present task-specific representative work and detailed implementation strategies to facilitate comparison and in-depth analysis. Quality assessments are then introduced for both qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Finally, this survey explores insights gained, providing current challenges and outlining prospects of AIGC-Brain.

In an effort to derive a formulation for practical settings, we consider limited and unknown sensor field-of-views (FoVs), sensors with limited local computational resources and communication channel capacity. The resulting distributed multi-object tracking algorithm involves solving an NP-hard multidimensional assignment problem either optimally for small-size problems or sub-optimally for general practical problems. For general problems, we propose an efficient distributed multi-object tracking algorithm that performs track-to-track fusion using a clustering-based analysis of the state space transformed into a density space to mitigate the complexity of the assignment problem. The proposed algorithm can more efficiently group local track estimates for fusion than existing approaches. To ensure we achieve globally consistent identities for tracks across a network of nodes as objects move between FoVs, we develop a graph-based algorithm to achieve label consensus and minimise track segmentation.

The hyperbolic version of the Atiyah-Sutcliffe conjecture $1$ (AS conjecture $1$) states that $D$ is nowhere vanishing. AS conjecture $2$ (hyperbolic version) is the stronger statement that $|D(\\mathbf{x})| \\geq 1$ for any $\\mathbf{x} \\in C_n(H^3)$. In this short article, we prove AS conjecture $2$ for hyperbolic convex coplanar quadrilaterals, that is for configurations of $4$ points in $H^2$ with none of the points in the configuration lying in the convex hull of the other three. We also obtain Y. Zhang and J. Ma's result, namely AS conjecture $1$ for non-convex quadrilaterals in $H^2$.

{"text": "Title: A Distributed SDN Control Plane for Consistent Policy Updates\nAbstract: Software-defined networking (SDN) is a novel paradigm that out-sources the control of packet-forwarding switches to a set of software controllers. The most fundamental task of these controllers is the correct implementation of the \\emph{network policy}, i.e., the intended network behavior. In essence, such a policy specifies the rules by which packets must be forwarded across the network. This paper studies a distributed SDN control plane that enables \\emph{concurrent} and \\emph{robust} policy implementation. We introduce a formal model describing the interaction between the data plane and a distributed control plane (consisting of a collection of fault-prone controllers). Then we formulate the problem of \\emph{consistent} composition of concurrent network policy updates (short: the \\emph{CPC Problem}). To anticipate scenarios in which some conflicting policy updates must be rejected, we enable the composition via a natural \\emph{transactional} interface with all-or-nothing semantics.

{"text": "Title: Certifying the novelty of equichordal tight fusion frames\nAbstract: An equichordal tight fusion frame (ECTFF) is a finite sequence of equi-dimensional subspaces of a finite-dimensional Hilbert space that achieves equality in Conway, Hardin and Sloane's simplex bound. Every ECTFF is a type of optimal Grassmannian code, being a way to arrange a given number of members of a Grassmannian so that the minimal chordal distance between any pair of them is as large as possible. Any nontrivial ECTFF has both a Naimark complement and spatial complement which themselves are ECTFFs. It turns out that whenever the number of subspaces is at least five, taking iterated alternating Naimark and spatial complements of one ECTFF yields an infinite family of them with distinct parameters. This makes it challenging to certify the novelty of any recently discovered ECTFF: how can one guarantee that it does not arise from any previously known construction in such a Naimark-spatial way? In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem, showing that any ECTFF is a member of a Naimark-spatial family originating from either a trivial ECTFF or one with unique \"minimal\" parameters. In the latter case, if its minimal parameters do not match those of any previously known ECTFF, it is certifiably new. As a proof of concept, we then use these ideas to certify the novelty of some ECTFFs arising from a new method for constructing them from difference families for finite abelian groups. This method properly generalizes King's construction of ECTFFs from semiregular divisible difference sets.", "field": "math", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Not Only Rewards But Also Constraints: Applications on Legged Robot Locomotion\nAbstract: Several earlier studies have shown impressive control performance in complex robotic systems by designing the controller using a neural network and training it with model-free reinforcement learning. However, these outstanding controllers with natural motion style and high task performance are developed through extensive reward engineering, which is a highly laborious and time-consuming process of designing numerous reward terms and determining suitable reward coefficients. In this work, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework for training neural network controllers for complex robotic systems consisting of both rewards and constraints. To let the engineers appropriately reflect their intent to constraints and handle them with minimal computation overhead, two constraint types and an efficient policy optimization algorithm are suggested. The learning framework is applied to train locomotion controllers for several legged robots with different morphology and physical attributes to traverse challenging terrains. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that performant controllers can be trained with significantly less reward engineering, by tuning only a single reward coefficient. Furthermore, a more straightforward and intuitive engineering process can be utilized, thanks to the interpretability and generalizability of constraints.

{"text": "Title: Learning to Prompt with Text Only Supervision for Vision-Language Models\nAbstract: Foundational vision-language models such as CLIP are becoming a new paradigm in vision, due to their excellent generalization abilities. However, adapting these models for downstream tasks while maintaining their generalization remains a challenge. In literature, one branch of methods adapts CLIP by learning prompts using visual information. While effective, most of these works require labeled data which is not practical, and often struggle to generalize towards new datasets due to over-fitting on the source data. An alternative approach resorts to training-free methods by generating class descriptions from large language models (LLMs) and perform prompt ensembling. However, these methods often generate class specific prompts that cannot be transferred to other classes, which incur higher costs by generating LLM descriptions for each class separately. In this work, we propose to combine the strengths of these both streams of methods by learning prompts using only text data derived from LLMs. As supervised training of prompts is not trivial due to absence of images, we develop a training approach that allows prompts to extract rich contextual knowledge from LLM data. Moreover, with LLM contextual data mapped within the learned prompts, it enables zero-shot transfer of prompts to new classes and datasets potentially cutting the LLM prompt engineering cost. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that learns generalized prompts using text only data.

{"text": "Title: Fully Automated Image De-fencing using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks\nAbstract: Image de-fencing is one of the important aspects of recreational photography in which the objective is to remove the fence texture present in an image and generate an aesthetically pleasing version of the same image without the fence texture. In this paper, we aim to develop an automated and effective technique for fence removal and image reconstruction using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs). These networks have been successfully applied in several domains of Computer Vision focusing on image generation and rendering. Our initial approach is based on a two-stage architecture involving two cGANs that generate the fence mask and the inpainted image, respectively. Training of these networks is carried out independently and, during evaluation, the input image is passed through the two generators in succession to obtain the de-fenced image. The results obtained from this approach are satisfactory, but the response time is long since the image has to pass through two sets of convolution layers. To reduce the response time, we propose a second approach involving only a single cGAN architecture that is trained using the ground-truth of fenced de-fenced image pairs along with the edge map of the fenced image produced by the Canny Filter. Incorporation of the edge map helps the network to precisely detect the edges present in the input image, and also imparts it an ability to carry out high quality de-fencing in an efficient manner, even in the presence of a fewer number of layers as compared to the two-stage network. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results reported in the manuscript reveal that the de-fenced images generated by the single-stage de-fencing network have similar visual quality to those produced by the two-stage network. Comparative performance analysis also emphasizes the effectiveness of our approach over state-of-the-art image de-fencing techniques.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Optimal Placement of Dynamic Var Sources by Using Empirical Controllability Covariance\nAbstract: In this paper, the empirical controllability covariance (ECC), which is calculated around the considered operating condition of a power system, is applied to quantify the degree of controllability of system voltages under specific dynamic var source locations. An optimal dynamic var source placement method addressing fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR) issues is further formulated as an optimization problem that maximizes the determinant of ECC. The optimization problem is effectively solved by the NOMAD solver, which implements the Mesh Adaptive Direct Search algorithm. The proposed method is tested on an NPCC 140-bus system and the results show that the proposed method with fault specified ECC can solve the FIDVR issue caused by the most severe contingency with fewer dynamic var sources than the Voltage Sensitivity Index (VSI) based method. The proposed method with fault unspecified ECC does not depend on the settings of the contingency and can address more FIDVR issues than VSI method when placing the same number of SVCs under different fault durations. It is also shown that the proposed method can help mitigate voltage collapse.", "field": "math", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: DEM: A Method for Certifying Deep Neural Network Classifier Outputs in Aerospace\nAbstract: Software development in the aerospace domain requires adhering to strict, high-quality standards. While there exist regulatory guidelines for commercial software in this domain (e.g., ARP-4754 and DO-178), these do not apply to software with deep neural network (DNN) components. Consequently, it is unclear how to allow aerospace systems to benefit from the deep learning revolution. Our work here seeks to address this challenge with a novel, output-centric approach for DNN certification. Our method employs statistical verification techniques, and has the key advantage of being able to flag specific inputs for which the DNN's output may be unreliable - so that they may be later inspected by a human expert. To achieve this, our method conducts a statistical analysis of the DNN's predictions for other, nearby inputs, in order to detect inconsistencies. This is in contrast to existing techniques, which typically attempt to certify the entire DNN, as opposed to individual outputs. Our method uses the DNN as a black-box, and makes no assumptions about its topology. We hope that this work constitutes another step towards integrating DNNs in safety-critical applications - especially in the aerospace domain, where high standards of quality and reliability are crucial.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Towards a Formal Modelling, Analysis, and Verification of a Clone Node Attack Detection Scheme in the Internet of Things\nAbstract: In a clone node attack, an attacker attempted to physically capture the devices to gather sensitive information to conduct various insider attacks. Several solutions for detecting clone node attacks on IoT networks have been presented in the viewpoints above. These solutions are focused on specific system designs, processes, and feature sets and act as a high-level abstraction of underlying system architectures based on a few performance requirements. However, critical features like formal analysis, modelling, and verification are frequently overlooked in existing proposed solutions aimed at verifying the correctness and robustness of systems in order to ensure that no problematic scenarios or anomalies exist. This paper presents a formal analysis, modelling, and verification of our existing proposed clone node attack detection scheme in IoT. Firstly, we modelled the architectural components of the proposed scheme using High-Level Petri Nets (HLPNs) and then mapped them using their specified functionalities. Secondly, we defined and analysed the behavioural properties of the proposed scheme using Z specification language. Furthermore, we used the Satisfiability Modulo Theories Library (SMT-Lib) and the Z3 Solver to validate and demonstrate the overall functionality of the proposed scheme. Finally, in addition to modelling and analysis, this work employs Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs), which combine Petri Nets with a high-level programming language, making them more suitable for large-scale system modelling. To perform the simulations in CPN, we used both timed and untimed models, where timed models are used to evaluate performance, and untimed models are used to validate logical validity.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: CLASS-M: Adaptive stain separation-based contrastive learning with pseudo-labeling for histopathological image classification\nAbstract: Histopathological image classification is an important task in medical image analysis. Recent approaches generally rely on weakly supervised learning due to the ease of acquiring case-level labels from pathology reports. However, patch-level classification is preferable in applications where only a limited number of cases are available or when local prediction accuracy is critical. On the other hand, acquiring extensive datasets with localized labels for training is not feasible. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised patch-level histopathological image classification model, named CLASS-M, that does not require extensively labeled datasets. CLASS-M is formed by two main parts: a contrastive learning module that uses separated Hematoxylin and Eosin images generated through an adaptive stain separation process, and a module with pseudo-labels using MixUp. We compare our model with other state-of-the-art models on two clear cell renal cell carcinoma datasets. We demonstrate that our CLASS-M model has the best performance on both datasets.

{"text": "Title: Improving the Deployment of Recycling Classification through Efficient Hyper-Parameter Analysis\nAbstract: The paradigm of automated waste classification has recently seen a shift in the domain of interest from conventional image processing techniques to powerful computer vision algorithms known as convolutional neural networks (CNN). Historically, CNNs have demonstrated a strong dependency on powerful hardware for real-time classification, yet the need for deployment on weaker embedded devices is greater than ever. The work in this paper proposes a methodology for reconstructing and tuning conventional image classification models, using EfficientNets, to decrease their parameterisation with no trade-off in model accuracy and develops a pipeline through TensorRT for accelerating such models to run at real-time on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano embedded device. The train-deployment discrepancy, relating how poor data augmentation leads to a discrepancy in model accuracy between training and deployment, is often neglected in many papers and thus the work is extended by analysing and evaluating the impact real world perturbations had on model accuracy once deployed. The scope of the work concerns developing a more efficient variant of WasteNet, a collaborative recycling classification model. The newly developed model scores a test-set accuracy of 95.8% with a real world accuracy of 95%, a 14% increase over the original. Our acceleration pipeline boosted model throughput by 750% to 24 inferences per second on the Jetson Nano and real-time latency of the system was verified through servomotor latency analysis.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

While more than 90% of blocks are currently built via MEV-Boost, trade-offs between builders' strategic behaviors and auction design remain poorly understood. In this paper we address this gap. We introduce a game-theoretic model for MEV-Boost auctions and use simulations to study different builders' bidding strategies observed in practice.

{"text": "Title: Space reduction techniques for the $3$-wise Kemeny problem\nAbstract: Kemeny's rule is one of the most studied and well-known voting schemes with various important applications in computational social choice and biology. Recently, Kemeny's rule was generalized via a set-wise approach by Gilbert et. al. This paradigm presents interesting advantages in comparison with Kemeny's rule since not only pairwise comparisons but also the discordance between the winners of subsets of three alternatives are also taken into account in the definition of the $3$-wise Kendall-tau distance between two rankings. In spite of the NP-hardness of the 3-wise Kemeny problem which consists of computing the set of $3$-wise consensus rankings, namely rankings whose total $3$-wise Kendall-tau distance to a given voting profile is minimized, we establish in this paper several generalizations of the Major Order Theorems, as obtained by Milosz and Hamel for Kemeny's rule, for the $3$-wise Kemeny voting schemes to achieve a substantial search space reduction by efficiently determining in polynomial time the relative orders of pairs of alternatives. Essentially, our theorems quantify precisely the nontrivial property that if the preference for an alternative over another one in an election is strong enough, not only in the head-to-head competition but even when taking into account one or two more alternatives, then the relative order of these two alternatives in all $3$-wise consensus rankings must be as expected. As an application, we also obtain an improvement of the Major Order Theorems for Kememy's rule. Moreover, we show that the well-known $3/4$-majority rule of Betzler et al. for Kemeny's rule is only valid in general for elections with no more than $5$ alternatives with respect to the $3$-wise Kemeny scheme.

{"text": "Title: Scalable network reconstruction in subquadratic time\nAbstract: Network reconstruction consists in determining the unobserved pairwise couplings between $N$ nodes given only observational data on the resulting behavior that is conditioned on those couplings -- typically a time-series or independent samples from a graphical model. A major obstacle to the scalability of algorithms proposed for this problem is a seemingly unavoidable quadratic complexity of $O(N^2)$, corresponding to the requirement of each possible pairwise coupling being contemplated at least once, despite the fact that most networks of interest are sparse, with a number of non-zero couplings that is only $O(N)$. Here we present a general algorithm applicable to a broad range of reconstruction problems that achieves its result in subquadratic time, with a data-dependent complexity loosely upper bounded by $O(N^{3/2}\\log N)$, but with a more typical log-linear complexity of $O(N\\log^2N)$. Our algorithm relies on a stochastic second neighbor search that produces the best edge candidates with high probability, thus bypassing an exhaustive quadratic search. In practice, our algorithm achieves a performance that is many orders of magnitude faster than the quadratic baseline, allows for easy parallelization, and thus enables the reconstruction of networks with hundreds of thousands and even millions of nodes and edges.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

We argue that the minimal expected value of the square loss is inappropriate to measure the generalization error in approximation of compositional functions in order to take full advantage of the compositional structure. Instead, we measure the generalization error in the sense of maximum loss, and sometimes, as a pointwise error.

{"text": "Title: Edge-Linear First-Order Dependency Parsing with Undirected Minimum Spanning Tree Inference\nAbstract: The run time complexity of state-of-the-art inference algorithms in graph-based dependency parsing is super-linear in the number of input words (n). Recently, pruning algorithms for these models have shown to cut a large portion of the graph edges, with minimal damage to the resulting parse trees. Solving the inference problem in run time complexity determined solely by the number of edges (m) is hence of obvious importance. We propose such an inference algorithm for first-order models, which encodes the problem as a minimum spanning tree (MST) problem in an undirected graph. This allows us to utilize state-of-the-art undirected MST algorithms whose run time is O(m) at expectation and with a very high probability. A directed parse tree is then inferred from the undirected MST and is subsequently improved with respect to the directed parsing model through local greedy updates, both steps running in O(n) time. In experiments with 18 languages, a variant of the first-order MSTParser (McDonald et al., 2005b) that employs our algorithm performs very similarly to the original parser that runs an O(n^2) directed MST inference.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Adaptive Belief Discretization for POMDP Planning\nAbstract: Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) is a widely used model to represent the interaction of an environment and an agent, under state uncertainty. Since the agent does not observe the environment state, its uncertainty is typically represented through a probabilistic belief. While the set of possible beliefs is infinite, making exact planning intractable, the belief space's complexity (and hence planning complexity) is characterized by its covering number. Many POMDP solvers uniformly discretize the belief space and give the planning error in terms of the (typically unknown) covering number. We instead propose an adaptive belief discretization scheme, and give its associated planning error. We furthermore characterize the covering number with respect to the POMDP parameters. This allows us to specify the exact memory requirements on the planner, needed to bound the value function error. We then propose a novel, computationally efficient solver using this scheme.

{"text": "Title: Channel Estimation for FAS-assisted Multiuser mmWave Systems\nAbstract: This letter investigates the challenge of channel estimation in a multiuser millimeter-wave (mmWave) time-division duplexing (TDD) system. In this system, the base station (BS) employs a multi-antenna uniform linear array (ULA), while each mobile user is equipped with a fluid antenna system (FAS). Accurate channel state information (CSI) plays a crucial role in the precise placement of antennas in FAS. Traditional channel estimation methods designed for fixed-antenna systems are inadequate due to the high dimensionality of FAS. To address this issue, we propose a low-sample-size sparse channel reconstruction (L3SCR) method, capitalizing on the sparse propagation paths characteristic of mmWave channels. In this approach, each fluid antenna only needs to switch and measure the channel at a few specific locations.

{"text": "Title: On Model Compression for Neural Networks: Framework, Algorithm, and Convergence Guarantee\nAbstract: Model compression is a crucial part of deploying neural networks (NNs), especially when the memory and storage of computing devices are limited in many applications. This paper focuses on two model compression techniques: low-rank approximation and weight pruning in neural networks, which are very popular nowadays. However, training NN with low-rank approximation and weight pruning always suffers significant accuracy loss and convergence issues. In this paper, a holistic framework is proposed for model compression from a novel perspective of nonconvex optimization by designing an appropriate objective function. Then, we introduce NN-BCD, a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to solve the nonconvex optimization. One advantage of our algorithm is that an efficient iteration scheme can be derived with closed-form, which is gradient-free. Therefore, our algorithm will not suffer from vanishing/exploding gradient problems. Furthermore, with the Kurdyka-{\\L}ojasiewicz (K{\\L}) property of our objective function, we show that our algorithm globally converges to a critical point at the rate of O(1/k), where k denotes the number of iterations. Lastly, extensive experiments with tensor train decomposition and weight pruning demonstrate the efficiency and superior performance of the proposed framework.

Next, we prove that estimating the mean of a heavy-tailed distribution with bounded $k$th moments requires $\\tilde{\\Omega}\\left(\\frac{d}{\\alpha^{k/(k-1)} \\varepsilon} + \\frac{d}{\\alpha^2}\\right)$ samples. Previous work for this problem was only able to establish this lower bound against pure differential privacy, or in the special case of $k = 2$. Our techniques follow the method of fingerprinting and are generally quite simple. Our lower bound for heavy-tailed estimation is based on a black-box reduction from privately estimating identity-covariance Gaussians.

By careful analysis of an implicit auxiliary integral equation, it is shown for a wide class of potentials that below a certain `critical threshold' there are exactly as many stationary measures as extrema of the potential, while above another the stationary measure is unique, and consequently phase transition(s) between. For symmetric bistable potentials, these critical thresholds are proven to be equal and a strictly increasing function of the aggregation parameter.

In initial studies of massive MIMO, the system has been considered to be perfectly synchronized throughout the entire cells. However, perfect synchronization may be hard to attain in practice. Therefore, we study a massive MIMO system whose cells are not synchronous to each other, while transmissions in a cell are still synchronous. We analyze an asynchronous downlink massive MIMO system in terms of the coverage probability and the ergodic rate by means of the stochastic geometry tool. For comparison, we also obtain the results for the synchronous systems. In addition, we investigate the effect of the uplink power control and the number of pilot symbols on the downlink ergodic rate, and we observe that there is an optimal value for the number of pilot symbols maximizing the downlink ergodic rate of a cell. Our results also indicate that, compared to the cases with synchronous transmission, the downlink ergodic rate is more sensitive to the uplink power control in the asynchronous mode.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

Another challenge in using machine learning methods to automatically detect falls is the choice of engineered features.

{"text": "Title: Spectral-based Graph Neutral Networks for Complementary Item Recommendation\nAbstract: Modeling complementary relationships greatly helps recommender systems to accurately and promptly recommend the subsequent items when one item is purchased. Unlike traditional similar relationships, items with complementary relationships may be purchased successively (such as iPhone and Airpods Pro), and they not only share relevance but also exhibit dissimilarity. Since the two attributes are opposites, modeling complementary relationships is challenging. Previous attempts to exploit these relationships have either ignored or oversimplified the dissimilarity attribute, resulting in ineffective modeling and an inability to balance the two attributes. Since Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can capture the relevance and dissimilarity between nodes in the spectral domain, we can leverage spectral-based GNNs to effectively understand and model complementary relationships. In this study, we present a novel approach called Spectral-based Complementary Graph Neural Networks (SComGNN) that utilizes the spectral properties of complementary item graphs. We make the first observation that complementary relationships consist of low-frequency and mid-frequency components, corresponding to the relevance and dissimilarity attributes, respectively. Based on this spectral observation, we design spectral graph convolutional networks with low-pass and mid-pass filters to capture the low-frequency and mid-frequency components. Additionally, we propose a two-stage attention mechanism to adaptively integrate and balance the two attributes.

Methodology: We analyze the frequency and trend of adversarial techniques, followed by a qualitative analysis of the implementation of techniques. Next, we perform association rule mining to identify pairs of techniques recurring in APT attacks. We then perform qualitative analysis to identify the underlying relations among the techniques in the recurring pairs. Findings: The set of 667 CTI reports documents 10,370 techniques in total, and we identify 19 prevalent techniques accounting for 37.3\\% of documented techniques. We also identify 425 statistically significant recurring pairs and seven types of relations among the techniques in these pairs.

Applications are foreseen in Information Geometry.

{"text": "Title: LMBot: Distilling Graph Knowledge into Language Model for Graph-less Deployment in Twitter Bot Detection\nAbstract: As malicious actors employ increasingly advanced and widespread bots to disseminate misinformation and manipulate public opinion, the detection of Twitter bots has become a crucial task. Though graph-based Twitter bot detection methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, we find that their inference depends on the neighbor users multi-hop away from the targets, and fetching neighbors is time-consuming and may introduce bias. At the same time, we find that after finetuning on Twitter bot detection, pretrained language models achieve competitive performance and do not require a graph structure during deployment. Inspired by this finding, we propose a novel bot detection framework LMBot that distills the knowledge of graph neural networks (GNNs) into language models (LMs) for graph-less deployment in Twitter bot detection to combat the challenge of data dependency. Moreover, LMBot is compatible with graph-based and graph-less datasets. Specifically, we first represent each user as a textual sequence and feed them into the LM for domain adaptation. For graph-based datasets, the output of LMs provides input features for the GNN, enabling it to optimize for bot detection and distill knowledge back to the LM in an iterative, mutually enhancing process. Armed with the LM, we can perform graph-less inference, which resolves the graph data dependency and sampling bias issues. For datasets without graph structure, we simply replace the GNN with an MLP, which has also shown strong performance. Our experiments demonstrate that LMBot achieves state-of-the-art performance on four Twitter bot detection benchmarks. Extensive studies also show that LMBot is more robust, versatile, and efficient compared to graph-based Twitter bot detection methods.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

The algorithm achieves optimality by using the new notion of a canonical DR-plan that also meets various desirable, previously studied criteria.

{"text": "Title: An Adaptive Incremental Gradient Method With Support for Non-Euclidean Norms\nAbstract: Stochastic variance reduced methods have shown strong performance in solving finite-sum problems. However, these methods usually require the users to manually tune the step-size, which is time-consuming or even infeasible for some large-scale optimization tasks. To overcome the problem, we propose and analyze several novel adaptive variants of the popular SAGA algorithm. Eventually, we design a variant of Barzilai-Borwein step-size which is tailored for the incremental gradient method to ensure memory efficiency and fast convergence. We establish its convergence guarantees under general settings that allow non-Euclidean norms in the definition of smoothness and the composite objectives, which cover a broad range of applications in machine learning. We improve the analysis of SAGA to support non-Euclidean norms, which fills the void of existing work. Numerical experiments on standard datasets demonstrate a competitive performance of the proposed algorithm compared with existing variance-reduced methods and their adaptive variants.", "field": "math", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Sorting Can Exponentially Speed Up Pure Dynamic Programming\nAbstract: Many discrete minimization problems, including various versions of the shortest path problem, can be efficiently solved by dynamic programming (DP) algorithms that are \"pure\" in that they only perform basic operations, as min, max, +, but no conditional branchings via if-then-else in their recursion equations. It is known that any pure (min,+) DP algorithm solving the minimum weight spanning tree problem on undirected n-vertex graphs must perform at least $2^{\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})}$ operations. We show that this problem can be solved by a pure (min,max,+) DP algorithm performing only $O(n^3)$ operations. The algorithm is essentially a (min,max) algorithm: addition operations are only used to output the final values. The presence of both min and max operations means that now DP algorithms can sort: this explains the title of the paper.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Manipulating Trajectory Prediction with Backdoors\nAbstract: Autonomous vehicles ought to predict the surrounding agents' trajectories to allow safe maneuvers in uncertain and complex traffic situations. As companies increasingly apply trajectory prediction in the real world, security becomes a relevant concern. In this paper, we focus on backdoors - a security threat acknowledged in other fields but so far overlooked for trajectory prediction. To this end, we describe and investigate four triggers that could affect trajectory prediction. We then show that these triggers (for example, a braking vehicle), when correlated with a desired output (for example, a curve) during training, cause the desired output of a state-of-the-art trajectory prediction model. In other words, the model has good benign performance but is vulnerable to backdoors. This is the case even if the trigger maneuver is performed by a non-casual agent behind the target vehicle. As a side-effect, our analysis reveals interesting limitations within trajectory prediction models. Finally, we evaluate a range of defenses against backdoors. While some, like simple offroad checks, do not enable detection for all triggers, clustering is a promising candidate to support manual inspection to find backdoors.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Electromechanical phase-field fracture modelling of piezoresistive CNT-based composites\nAbstract: We present a novel computational framework to simulate the electromechanical response of self-sensing carbon nanotube (CNT)-based composites experiencing fracture. The computational framework combines electrical-deformation-fracture finite element modelling with a mixed micromechanics formulation. The latter is used to estimate the constitutive properties of CNT-based composites, including the elastic tensor, fracture energy, electrical conductivity, and linear piezoresistive coefficients. These properties are inputted into a coupled electro-structural finite element model, which simulates the evolution of cracks based upon phase-field fracture. The coupled physical problem is solved in a monolithic manner, exploiting the robustness and efficiency of a quasi-Newton algorithm. 2D and 3D boundary value problems are simulated to illustrate the potential of the modelling framework in assessing the influence of defects on the electromechanical response of meso- and macro-scale smart structures. Case studies aim at shedding light into the interplay between fracture and the electromechanical material response and include parametric analyses, validation against experiments and the simulation of complex cracking conditions (multiple defects, crack merging).

In the large self-propulsion force limit, we provide evidence of a phase transition from disordered to ordered motion which manifests itself as a change of type of the limit model (from hyperbolic to diffusive) at the crossing of a critical noise intensity. In the hyperbolic regime, the resulting model, referred to as the `Self-Organized Hydrodynamics (SOH)', consists of a system of compressible Euler equations with a speed constraint. We show that the range of SOH models obtained by this limit is restricted. To waive this restriction, we compute the Navier-Stokes diffusive corrections to the hydrodynamic model. Adding these diffusive corrections, the limit of a large propulsion force yields unrestricted SOH models and offers an alternative to the derivation of the SOH using kinetic models with speed constraints.", "field": "math", "label": 1}

Different sectors are beginning to use this disruptive technology to evaluate the risks and benefits. Sectors like finance, medicine, higher education, and wireless communication have research regarding blockchain. Futhermore, the need for security standards in this area of research is pivotal.

While some existing work focus on evaluating large language models performance on retrieving and answering questions from documents, assessing the LLMs performance on QA types that require exact answer selection from predefined options and numerical extraction is yet to be fully assessed. In this paper, we specifically focus on this underexplored context and conduct empirical analysis of LLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-3.5) on question types, including single-choice, yes-no, multiple-choice, and number extraction questions from documents in zero-shot setting. We use the CogTale dataset for evaluation, which provide human expert-tagged responses, offering a robust benchmark for precision and factual grounding. We found that LLMs, particularly GPT-4, can precisely answer many single-choice and yes-no questions given relevant context, demonstrating their efficacy in information retrieval tasks. However, their performance diminishes when confronted with multiple-choice and number extraction formats, lowering the overall performance of the model on this task, indicating that these models may not yet be sufficiently reliable for the task. This limits the applications of LLMs on applications demanding precise information extraction from documents, such as meta-analysis tasks.

Interestingly, this result does not require assumptions on the prior distribution. The proof is based on a dual bound of the infinite-dimensional linear program. Numerical experiments without restrictions on bidding strategies show that for first-price auctions and discretisations up to 21 of the type and bid space, increasing discretisation sizes actually increase the concentration of Bayesian Coarse Correlated Equilibrium over the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium, so long as the prior c.d.f. is concave.

However, this does not address the question of whether overfitting might occur non-asymptotically, after some bounded number of iterations. In this paper, we formally show that standard gradient methods (in particular, gradient flow, gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent) never overfit on separable data: If we run these methods for $T$ iterations on a dataset of size $m$, both the empirical risk and the generalization error decrease at an essentially optimal rate of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\gamma^2 T)$ up till $T\\approx m$, at which point the generalization error remains fixed at an essentially optimal level of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\gamma^2 m)$ regardless of how large $T$ is.

{"text": "Title: SCALA: Sparsification-based Contrastive Learning for Anomaly Detection on Attributed Networks\nAbstract: Anomaly detection on attributed networks aims to find the nodes whose behaviors are significantly different from other majority nodes. Generally, network data contains information about relationships between entities, and the anomaly is usually embodied in these relationships. Therefore, how to comprehensively model complex interaction patterns in networks is still a major focus. It can be observed that anomalies in networks violate the homophily assumption. However, most existing studies only considered this phenomenon obliquely rather than explicitly. Besides, the node representation of normal entities can be perturbed easily by the noise relationships introduced by anomalous nodes. To address the above issues, we present a novel contrastive learning framework for anomaly detection on attributed networks, \\textbf{SCALA}, aiming to improve the embedding quality of the network and provide a new measurement of qualifying the anomaly score for each node by introducing sparsification into the conventional method. Extensive experiments are conducted on five benchmark real-world datasets and the results show that SCALA consistently outperforms all baseline methods significantly.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: GEqO: ML-Accelerated Semantic Equivalence Detection\nAbstract: Large scale analytics engines have become a core dependency for modern data-driven enterprises to derive business insights and drive actions. These engines support a large number of analytic jobs processing huge volumes of data on a daily basis, and workloads are often inundated with overlapping computations across multiple jobs. Reusing common computation is crucial for efficient cluster resource utilization and reducing job execution time. Detecting common computation is the first and key step for reducing this computational redundancy. However, detecting equivalence on large-scale analytics engines requires efficient and scalable solutions that are fully automated. In addition, to maximize computation reuse, equivalence needs to be detected at the semantic level instead of just the syntactic level (i.e., the ability to detect semantic equivalence of seemingly different-looking queries). Unfortunately, existing solutions fall short of satisfying these requirements. In this paper, we take a major step towards filling this gap by proposing GEqO, a portable and lightweight machine-learning-based framework for efficiently identifying semantically equivalent computations at scale. GEqO introduces two machine-learning-based filters that quickly prune out nonequivalent subexpressions and employs a semi-supervised learning feedback loop to iteratively improve its model with an intelligent sampling mechanism. Further, with its novel database-agnostic featurization method, GEqO can transfer the learning from one workload and database to another. Our extensive empirical evaluation shows that, on TPC-DS-like queries, GEqO yields significant performance gains-up to 200x faster than automated verifiers-and finds up to 2x more equivalences than optimizer and signature-based equivalence detection approaches.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

Thus, the blessing of compositionality mitigates the curse of dimensionality. On the other hand, a theorem called good propagation of errors allows to `lift' theorems about shallow networks to those about deep networks with an appropriate choice of norms, smoothness, etc. We illustrate this in three contexts where each channel in the deep network calculates a spherical polynomial, a non-smooth ReLU network, or another zonal function network related closely with the ReLU network.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Dynamical processes on metric networks\nAbstract: The structure of a network has a major effect on dynamical processes on that network. Many studies of the interplay between network structure and dynamics have focused on models of phenomena such as disease spread, opinion formation and changes, coupled oscillators, and random walks. In parallel to these developments, there have been many studies of wave propagation and other spatially extended processes on networks. These latter studies consider metric networks, in which the edges are associated with real intervals. Metric networks give a mathematical framework to describe dynamical processes that include both temporal and spatial evolution of some quantity of interest -- such as the concentration of a diffusing substance or the amplitude of a wave -- by using edge-specific intervals that quantify distance information between nodes. Dynamical processes on metric networks often take the form of partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we present a collection of techniques and paradigmatic linear PDEs that are useful to investigate the interplay between structure and dynamics in metric networks. We start by considering a time-independent Schr\\\"odinger equation. We then use both finite-difference and spectral approaches to study the Poisson, heat, and wave equations as paradigmatic examples of elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic PDE problems on metric networks. Our spectral approach is able to account for degenerate eigenmodes. In our numerical experiments, we consider metric networks with up to about $10^4$ nodes and about $10^4$ edges.

We identify several classes of voting rules that satisfy this notion. We also show that several voting rules including k-approval fail to satisfy this property. We characterize conditions under which voting rules are obviously manipulable. One of our insights is that certain rules are obviously manipulable when the number of alternatives is relatively large compared to the number of voters. In contrast to the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem, many of the rules we examined are not obviously manipulable. This reflects the relatively easier satisfiability of the notion and the zero information assumption of not obvious manipulability, as opposed to the perfect information assumption of strategyproofness. We also present algorithmic results for computing obvious manipulations and report on experiments.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

Traditional approaches often simplify the problem by imposing handcrafted priors on either the input point clouds or the resulting surface, a process that can necessitate tedious hyperparameter tuning. Conversely, deep learning models have the capability to directly learn the properties of input point clouds and desired surfaces from data. We study the influence of these handcrafted and learned priors on the precision and robustness of surface reconstruction techniques.

We present the Hebbian-augmented training algorithm (HAT) for combining gradient-based learning with an unsupervised rule on pre-synpatic activity, post-synaptic activities, and current weights. We test HAT's effect on a simple problem (Fashion-MNIST) and find consistently higher performance than supervised learning alone. This finding provides empirical evidence that unsupervised learning on synaptic activities provides a strong signal that can be used to augment gradient-based methods. We further find that the meta-learned update rule is a time-varying function; thus, it is difficult to pinpoint an interpretable Hebbian update rule that aids in training. We do find that the meta-learner eventually degenerates into a non-Hebbian rule that preserves important weights so as not to disturb the learner's convergence.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Theory of Solutions for An Inextensible Cantilever\nAbstract: Recent equations of motion for the large deflections of a cantilevered elastic beam are analyzed. In the traditional theory of beam (and plate) large deflections, nonlinear restoring forces are due to the effect of stretching on bending; for an inextensible cantilever, the enforcement of arc-length preservation leads to quasilinear stiffness effects and inertial effects that are both nonlinear and nonlocal. For this model, smooth solutions are constructed via a spectral Galerkin approach. Additional compactness is needed to pass to the limit, and this is obtained through a complex procession of higher energy estimates. Uniqueness is obtained through a non-trivial decomposition of the nonlinearity. The confounding effects of nonlinear inertia are overcome via the addition of structural (Kelvin-Voigt) damping to the equations of motion. Local well-posedness of smooth solutions is shown first in the absence of nonlinear inertial effects, and then shown with these inertial effects present, taking into account structural damping. With damping in force, global-in-time, strong well-posedness result is obtained by achieving exponential decay for small data.", "field": "math", "label": 1}

We explore the possibility of utilizing the sensing ability of radar to track and jam the aerial adversary target attempting to detect the transmission. Based on the echoes from the target, the extended Kalman filtering technique is employed to predict its trajectory as well as the corresponding channels. Depending on the maneuvering altitude of adversary target, two channel state information (CSI) models are considered, with the aim of maximizing the covert transmission rate by jointly designing the radar waveform and communication transmit beamforming vector based on the constructed channels. For perfect CSI under the free-space propagation model, by decoupling the joint design, we propose an efficient algorithm to guarantee that the target cannot detect the transmission. For imperfect CSI due to the multi-path components, a robust joint transmission scheme is proposed based on the property of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The convergence behaviour, tracking MSE, false alarm and missed detection probabilities, and covert transmission rate are evaluated. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms achieve accurate tracking. For both channel models, the proposed sensing-assisted covert transmission design is able to guarantee the covertness, and significantly outperforms the conventional schemes.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

Among them, text-to-image editing, or continuous text-to-image generation, attracts lots of attention and can potentially improve the quality of generated images. It's common to see that users may want to slightly edit the generated image by making minor modifications to their input textual descriptions for several rounds of diffusion inference. However, such an image editing process suffers from the low inference efficiency of many existing diffusion models even using GPU accelerators. To solve this problem, we introduce Fast Image Semantically Edit (FISEdit), a cached-enabled sparse diffusion model inference engine for efficient text-to-image editing. The key intuition behind our approach is to utilize the semantic mapping between the minor modifications on the input text and the affected regions on the output image. For each text editing step, FISEdit can automatically identify the affected image regions and utilize the cached unchanged regions' feature map to accelerate the inference process.

{"text": "Title: Context-Free TextSpotter for Real-Time and Mobile End-to-End Text Detection and Recognition\nAbstract: In the deployment of scene-text spotting systems on mobile platforms, lightweight models with low computation are preferable. In concept, end-to-end (E2E) text spotting is suitable for such purposes because it performs text detection and recognition in a single model. However, current state-of-the-art E2E methods rely on heavy feature extractors, recurrent sequence modellings, and complex shape aligners to pursue accuracy, which means their computations are still heavy. We explore the opposite direction: How far can we go without bells and whistles in E2E text spotting? To this end, we propose a text-spotting method that consists of simple convolutions and a few post-processes, named Context-Free TextSpotter. Experiments using standard benchmarks show that Context-Free TextSpotter achieves real-time text spotting on a GPU with only three million parameters, which is the smallest and fastest among existing deep text spotters, with an acceptable transcription quality degradation compared to heavier ones. Further, we demonstrate that our text spotter can run on a smartphone with affordable latency, which is valuable for building stand-alone OCR applications.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Unsupervised Program Synthesis for Images By Sampling Without Replacement\nAbstract: Program synthesis has emerged as a successful approach to the image parsing task. Most prior works rely on a two-step scheme involving supervised pretraining of a Seq2Seq model with synthetic programs followed by reinforcement learning (RL) for fine-tuning with real reference images. Fully unsupervised approaches promise to train the model directly on the target images without requiring curated pretraining datasets. However, they struggle with the inherent sparsity of meaningful programs in the search space. In this paper, we present the first unsupervised algorithm capable of parsing constructive solid geometry (CSG) images into context-free grammar (CFG) without pretraining via non-differentiable renderer. To tackle the \\emph{non-Markovian} sparse reward problem, we combine three key ingredients -- (i) a grammar-encoded tree LSTM ensuring program validity (ii) entropy regularization and (iii) sampling without replacement from the CFG syntax tree. Empirically, our algorithm recovers meaningful programs in large search spaces (up to $3.8 \\times 10^{28}$). Further, even though our approach is fully unsupervised, it generalizes better than supervised methods on the synthetic 2D CSG dataset.

Let $G$ be a finitely generated group admitting a $C^{1,\\alpha}$ action $\\rho$ with a free orbit on the circle, and such that the logarithms of derivatives of group elements are uniformly bounded at some point of the circle. We prove that if $G$ has spherical growth bounded by $c n^{d-1}$ and if the function $1/\\alpha^d$ is integrable near zero, then under some mild technical assumptions on $\\alpha$, there is a sequence of exceptional $C^{1,\\alpha}$ actions of $G$ which converge to $\\rho$ in the $C^1$ topology. As a consequence for a single diffeomorphism, we obtain that if the function $1/\\alpha$ is integrable near zero, then there exists a $C^{1,\\alpha}$ exceptional diffeomorphism of the circle. This corollary accounts for all previously known moduli of continuity for derivatives of exceptional diffeomorphisms. We also obtain a partial converse to our main result. For finitely generated free abelian groups, the existence of an exceptional action, together with some natural hypotheses on the derivatives of group elements, puts integrability restrictions on the modulus $\\alpha$.

In this paper we define an algebra structure on an RKHS that is equivalent to subconvolutivity of the weight for known examples (referred to as reproducing kernel Hilbert algebras, or RKHAs). We show that the class of RKHAs is closed under the Hilbert space tensor product and the pullback construction on the category of RKHSs.

{"text": "Title: The effect of approximate coarsest-level solves on the convergence of multigrid V-cycle methods\nAbstract: The multigrid V-cycle method is a popular method for solving systems of linear equations. It computes an approximate solution by using smoothing on fine levels and solving a system of linear equations on the coarsest level. Solving on the coarsest level depends on the size and difficulty of the problem. If the size permits, it is typical to use a direct method based on LU or Cholesky decomposition. In settings with large coarsest-level problems, approximate solvers such as iterative Krylov subspace methods, or direct methods based on low-rank approximation, are often used. The accuracy of the coarsest-level solver is typically determined based on the experience of the users with the concrete problems and methods. In this paper we present an approach to analyzing the effects of approximate coarsest-level solves on the convergence of the V-cycle method for symmetric positive definite problems. Using these results, we derive coarsest-level stopping criterion through which we may control the difference between the approximation computed by a V-cycle method with approximate coarsest-level solver and the approximation which would be computed if the coarsest-level problems were solved exactly. The coarsest-level stopping criterion may thus be set up such that the V-cycle method converges to a chosen finest-level accuracy in (nearly) the same number of V-cycle iterations as the V-cycle method with exact coarsest-level solver. We also utilize the theoretical results to discuss how the convergence of the V-cycle method may be affected by the choice of a tolerance in a coarsest-level stopping criterion based on the relative residual norm.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Data Assimilation in Chaotic Systems Using Deep Reinforcement Learning\nAbstract: Data assimilation (DA) plays a pivotal role in diverse applications, ranging from climate predictions and weather forecasts to trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles. A prime example is the widely used ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), which relies on linear updates to minimize variance among the ensemble of forecast states. Recent advancements have seen the emergence of deep learning approaches in this domain, primarily within a supervised learning framework. However, the adaptability of such models to untrained scenarios remains a challenge. In this study, we introduce a novel DA strategy that utilizes reinforcement learning (RL) to apply state corrections using full or partial observations of the state variables. Our investigation focuses on demonstrating this approach to the chaotic Lorenz '63 system, where the agent's objective is to minimize the root-mean-squared error between the observations and corresponding forecast states. Consequently, the agent develops a correction strategy, enhancing model forecasts based on available system state observations. Our strategy employs a stochastic action policy, enabling a Monte Carlo-based DA framework that relies on randomly sampling the policy to generate an ensemble of assimilated realizations. Results demonstrate that the developed RL algorithm performs favorably when compared to the EnKF. Additionally, we illustrate the agent's capability to assimilate non-Gaussian data, addressing a significant limitation of the EnKF.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: A direct approach for function approximation on data defined manifolds\nAbstract: In much of the literature on function approximation by deep networks, the function is assumed to be defined on some known domain, such as a cube or a sphere. In practice, the data might not be dense on these domains, and therefore, the approximation theory results are observed to be too conservative. In manifold learning, one assumes instead that the data is sampled from an unknown manifold; i.e., the manifold is defined by the data itself. Function approximation on this unknown manifold is then a two stage procedure: first, one approximates the Laplace-Beltrami operator (and its eigen-decomposition) on this manifold using a graph Laplacian, and next, approximates the target function using the eigen-functions. Alternatively, one estimates first some atlas on the manifold and then uses local approximation techniques based on the local coordinate charts. In this paper, we propose a more direct approach to function approximation on \\emph{unknown}, data defined manifolds without computing the eigen-decomposition of some operator or an atlas for the manifold, and without any kind of training in the classical sense. Our constructions are universal; i.e., do not require the knowledge of any prior on the target function other than continuity on the manifold. We estimate the degree of approximation. For smooth functions, the estimates do not suffer from the so-called saturation phenomenon. We demonstrate via a property called good propagation of errors how the results can be lifted for function approximation using deep networks where each channel evaluates a Gaussian network on a possibly unknown manifold.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: The covariant functoriality of graph algebras\nAbstract: In the standard category of directed graphs, graph morphisms map edges to edges.

They are typically trained in-domain, forego large-scale 2D pre-training and outperform alternatives that featurize the posed RGB-D multiview images instead. The gap in performance between methods that consume posed images versus post-processed 3D point clouds has fueled the belief that 2D and 3D perception require distinct model architectures. In this paper, we challenge this view and propose ODIN (Omni-Dimensional INstance segmentation), a model that can segment and label both 2D RGB images and 3D point clouds, using a transformer architecture that alternates between 2D within-view and 3D cross-view information fusion.

{"text": "Title: EcoFed: Efficient Communication for DNN Partitioning-based Federated Learning\nAbstract: Efficiently running federated learning (FL) on resource-constrained devices is challenging since they are required to train computationally intensive deep neural networks (DNN) independently. DNN partitioning-based FL (DPFL) has been proposed as one mechanism to accelerate training where the layers of a DNN (or computation) are offloaded from the device to the server. However, this creates significant communication overheads since the intermediate activation and gradient need to be transferred between the device and the server during training. While current research reduces the communication introduced by DNN partitioning using local loss-based methods, we demonstrate that these methods are ineffective in improving the overall efficiency (communication overhead and training speed) of a DPFL system. This is because they suffer from accuracy degradation and ignore the communication costs incurred when transferring the activation from the device to the server. This article proposes EcoFed - a communication efficient framework for DPFL systems. EcoFed eliminates the transmission of the gradient by developing pre-trained initialization of the DNN model on the device for the first time. This reduces the accuracy degradation seen in local loss-based methods. In addition, EcoFed proposes a novel replay buffer mechanism and implements a quantization-based compression technique to reduce the transmission of the activation. It is experimentally demonstrated that EcoFed can reduce the communication cost by up to 133x and accelerate training by up to 21x when compared to classic FL.

Here, we combine convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the model environment of a honeybee hive to automatically recognize all individuals in a dense group from raw image data. We create new, adapted individual labeling and use the segmentation architecture U-Net with a loss function dependent on both object identity and orientation.

The values are updated in the following way: 0s are changed to 1s at all positions where the value to the right is a 1, while 1s are changed to 0s at all positions where the values to the left and right are both 1. Though trivial to define, the behavior exhibited by Rule 110 is surprisingly intricate, and in (Cook, 2004) we showed that it is capable of emulating the activity of a Turing machine by encoding the Turing machine and its tape into a repeating left pattern, a central pattern, and a repeating right pattern, which Rule 110 then acts on. In this paper we provide an explicit compiler for converting a Turing machine into a Rule 110 initial state, and we present a general approach for proving that such constructions will work as intended. The simulation was originally assumed to require exponential time, but surprising results of Neary and Woods (2006) have shown that in fact, only polynomial time is required. We use the methods of Neary and Woods to exhibit a direct simulation of a Turing machine by a tag system in polynomial time.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Towards a quality metric for dense light fields\nAbstract: Light fields become a popular representation of three dimensional scenes, and there is interest in their processing, resampling, and compression. As those operations often result in loss of quality, there is a need to quantify it. In this work, we collect a new dataset of dense reference and distorted light fields as well as the corresponding quality scores which are scaled in perceptual units. The scores were acquired in a subjective experiment using an interactive light-field viewing setup. The dataset contains typical artifacts that occur in light-field processing chain due to light-field reconstruction, multi-view compression, and limitations of automultiscopic displays. We test a number of existing objective quality metrics to determine how well they can predict the quality of light fields. We find that the existing image quality metrics provide good measures of light-field quality, but require dense reference light- fields for optimal performance. For more complex tasks of comparing two distorted light fields, their performance drops significantly, which reveals the need for new, light-field-specific metrics.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Tensorial structure of the lifting doctrine in constructive domain theory\nAbstract: We present a survey of the two-dimensional and tensorial structure of the lifting doctrine in constructive domain theory. We establish the universal property of lifting of directed-complete partial orders (dcpos) as the Sierpi\\'nski cone, from which we deduce (1) that lifting forms a Kock-Z\\\"oberlein doctrine, (2) that lifting algebras, pointed dcpos, and inductive partial orders form canonically equivalent locally posetal 2-categories, and (3) that the category of lifting algebras is cocomplete, with connected colimits created by the forgetful functor to dcpos. Finally we deduce the symmetric monoidal closure of the Eilenberg-Moore resolution of the lifting 2-monad by means of smash products; these are shown to classify both bilinear maps and strict maps, which we prove to coincide in the constructive setting. We provide several concrete computations of the smash product as dcpo coequalisers and lifting algebra coequalisers, and compare these with the more abstract results of Seal. Although all these results are well-known classically, the existing proofs do not apply in a constructive setting; indeed, the classical analysis of the Eilenberg-Moore category of the lifting monad relies on the fact that all lifting algebras are free, a condition that is not known to hold constructively.", "field": "math", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: BA-SAM: Scalable Bias-Mode Attention Mask for Segment Anything Model\nAbstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of image resolution variation for the Segment Anything Model (SAM). SAM, known for its zero-shot generalizability, exhibits a performance degradation when faced with datasets with varying image sizes. Previous approaches tend to resize the image to a fixed size or adopt structure modifications, hindering the preservation of SAM's rich prior knowledge. Besides, such task-specific tuning necessitates a complete retraining of the model, which is cost-expensive and unacceptable for deployment in the downstream tasks. In this paper, we reformulate this issue as a length extrapolation problem, where token sequence length varies while maintaining a consistent patch size for images of different sizes. To this end, we propose Scalable Bias-Mode Attention Mask (BA-SAM) to enhance SAM's adaptability to varying image resolutions while eliminating the need for structure modifications. Firstly, we introduce a new scaling factor to ensure consistent magnitude in the attention layer's dot product values when the token sequence length changes. Secondly, we present a bias-mode attention mask that allows each token to prioritize neighboring information, mitigating the impact of untrained distant information. Our BA-SAM demonstrates efficacy in two scenarios: zero-shot and fine-tuning. Extensive evaluation on diverse datasets, including DIS5K, DUTS, ISIC, COD10K, and COCO, reveals its ability to significantly mitigate performance degradation in the zero-shot setting and achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a generalized model and benchmark, showcasing BA-SAM's generalizability across all four datasets simultaneously.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Evolution of Retweet Rates in Twitter User Careers: Analysis and Model\nAbstract: We study the evolution of the number of retweets received by Twitter users over the course of their \"careers\" on the platform. We find that on average the number of retweets received by users tends to increase over time. This is partly expected because users tend to gradually accumulate followers. Normalizing by the number of followers, however, reveals that the relative, per-follower retweet rate tends to be non-monotonic, maximized at a \"peak age\" after which it does not increase, or even decreases. We develop a simple mathematical model of the process behind this phenomenon, which assumes a constantly growing number of followers, each of whom loses interest over time.

{"text": "Title: TSGAN: An Optical-to-SAR Dual Conditional GAN for Optical based SAR Temporal Shifting\nAbstract: In contrast to the well-investigated field of SAR-to-Optical translation, this study explores the lesser-investigated domain of Optical-to-SAR translation, a challenging field due to the ill-posed nature of this translation. The complexity arises as a single optical data can have multiple SAR representations based on the SAR viewing geometry. We propose a novel approach, termed SAR Temporal Shifting, which inputs an optical data from the desired timestamp along with a SAR data from a different temporal point but with a consistent viewing geometry as the expected SAR data, both complemented with a change map of optical data during the intervening period. This model modifies the SAR data based on the changes observed in optical data to generate the SAR data for the desired timestamp. Our model, a dual conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), named Temporal Shifting GAN (TSGAN), incorporates a siamese encoder in both the Generator and the Discriminator. To prevent the model from overfitting on the input SAR data, we employed a change weighted loss function. Our approach surpasses traditional translation methods by eliminating the GAN's fiction phenomenon, particularly in unchanged regions, resulting in higher SSIM and PSNR in these areas. Additionally, modifications to the Pix2Pix architecture and the inclusion of attention mechanisms have enhanced the model's performance on all regions of the data. This research paves the way for leveraging legacy optical datasets, the most abundant and longstanding source of Earth imagery data, extending their use to SAR domains and temporal analyses. To foster further research, we provide the code, datasets used in our study, and a framework for generating paired SAR-Optical datasets for new regions of interest.

{"text": "Title: One Shot Learning as Instruction Data Prospector for Large Language Models\nAbstract: Aligning large language models(LLMs) with human is a critical step in effectively utilizing their pre-trained capabilities across a wide array of language tasks. Current instruction tuning practices often rely on expanding dataset size without a clear strategy for ensuring data quality, which can inadvertently introduce noise and degrade model performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Nuggets, a novel and efficient methodology that employs one shot learning to select high-quality instruction data from expansive datasets. Nuggets assesses the potential of individual instruction examples to act as effective one shot examples, thereby identifying those that can significantly enhance diverse task performance. Nuggets utilizes a scoring system based on the impact of candidate examples on the perplexity of a diverse anchor set, facilitating the selection of the most beneficial data for instruction tuning. Through rigorous testing on two benchmarks, including MT-Bench and Alpaca-Eval, we demonstrate that instruction tuning with the top 1% of Nuggets-curated examples substantially outperforms conventional methods that use the full dataset. These findings advocate for a data selection paradigm that prioritizes quality, offering a more efficient pathway to align LLMs with humans.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

The application of legislation to facts of a case we refer to as statutory reasoning, where those facts are also expressed in natural language. Computational statutory reasoning is distinct from most existing work in machine reading, in that much of the information needed for deciding a case is declared exactly once (a law), while the information needed in much of machine reading tends to be learned through distributional language statistics. To investigate the performance of natural language understanding approaches on statutory reasoning, we introduce a dataset, together with a legal-domain text corpus. Straightforward application of machine reading models exhibits low out-of-the-box performance on our questions, whether or not they have been fine-tuned to the legal domain. We contrast this with a hand-constructed Prolog-based system, designed to fully solve the task. These experiments support a discussion of the challenges facing statutory reasoning moving forward, which we argue is an interesting real-world task that can motivate the development of models able to utilize prescriptive rules specified in natural language.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Deep Demosaicing for Edge Implementation\nAbstract: Most digital cameras use sensors coated with a Color Filter Array (CFA) to capture channel components at every pixel location, resulting in a mosaic image that does not contain pixel values in all channels. Current research on reconstructing these missing channels, also known as demosaicing, introduces many artifacts, such as zipper effect and false color. Many deep learning demosaicing techniques outperform other classical techniques in reducing the impact of artifacts. However, most of these models tend to be over-parametrized. Consequently, edge implementation of the state-of-the-art deep learning-based demosaicing algorithms on low-end edge devices is a major challenge. We provide an exhaustive search of deep neural network architectures and obtain a pareto front of Color Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (CPSNR) as the performance criterion versus the number of parameters as the model complexity that beats the state-of-the-art. Architectures on the pareto front can then be used to choose the best architecture for a variety of resource constraints.

{"text": "Title: Accurate Leukocyte Detection Based on Deformable-DETR and Multi-Level Feature Fusion for Aiding Diagnosis of Blood Diseases\nAbstract: In standard hospital blood tests, the traditional process requires doctors to manually isolate leukocytes from microscopic images of patients' blood using microscopes. These isolated leukocytes are then categorized via automatic leukocyte classifiers to determine the proportion and volume of different types of leukocytes present in the blood samples, aiding disease diagnosis. This methodology is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive, but it also has a high propensity for errors due to factors such as image quality and environmental conditions, which could potentially lead to incorrect subsequent classifications and misdiagnosis. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative method of leukocyte detection: the Multi-level Feature Fusion and Deformable Self-attention DETR (MFDS-DETR). To tackle the issue of leukocyte scale disparity, we designed the High-level Screening-feature Fusion Pyramid (HS-FPN), enabling multi-level fusion. This model uses high-level features as weights to filter low-level feature information via a channel attention module and then merges the screened information with the high-level features, thus enhancing the model's feature expression capability. Further, we address the issue of leukocyte feature scarcity by incorporating a multi-scale deformable self-attention module in the encoder and using the self-attention and cross-deformable attention mechanisms in the decoder, which aids in the extraction of the global features of the leukocyte feature maps. The effectiveness, superiority, and generalizability of the proposed MFDS-DETR method are confirmed through comparisons with other cutting-edge leukocyte detection models using the private WBCDD, public LISC and BCCD datasets.

Here we propose a Cross-modal PROtotype driven NETwork (XPRONET) to promote cross-modal pattern learning and exploit it to improve the task of radiology report generation. This is achieved by three well-designed, fully differentiable and complementary modules: a shared cross-modal prototype matrix to record the cross-modal prototypes; a cross-modal prototype network to learn the cross-modal prototypes and embed the cross-modal information into the visual and textual features; and an improved multi-label contrastive loss to enable and enhance multi-label prototype learning.

This captures many classical problems which are solved using DP such as the knapsack problem, the airplane refueling problem, and the minimal-weight polygon triangulation problem. We observe that for many of these problems, the tensor naturally has low tensor rank or low slice rank. We then give new algorithms and a web of fine-grained reductions to tightly determine the complexity of these problems. For instance, we show that a polynomial speedup over the DP algorithm is possible when the tensor rank is a constant or the slice rank is 1, but that such a speedup is impossible if the tensor rank is slightly super-constant (assuming SETH) or the slice rank is at least 3 (assuming the APSP conjecture).

The CNN architecture constitutes a variety of different types of layers including the convolution layer and the max-pooling layer. CNN practitioners widely understand the fact that the stability of learning depends on how to initialize the model parameters in each layer. Nowadays, no one doubts that the de facto standard scheme for initialization is the so-called Kaiming initialization that has been developed by He et al. The Kaiming scheme was derived from a much simpler model than the currently used CNN structure having evolved since the emergence of the Kaiming scheme. The Kaiming model consists only of the convolution and fully connected layers, ignoring the max-pooling layer and the global average pooling layer. In this study, we derived the initialization scheme again not from the simplified Kaiming model, but precisely from the modern CNN architectures, and empirically investigated how the new initialization method performs compared to the de facto standard ones that are widely used today.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

We accomplish this by employing a suitable normalization technique on the original sample covariance matrix. Following this, we establish a harmonic central limit theorem for linear spectral statistics within this expansive framework. This achievement effectively eliminates the necessity for a bounded spectral norm on the population covariance matrix and relaxes constraints on the rates of dimension $p$ and sample size $n$, thereby significantly broadening the applicability of these results in the field of high-dimensional statistics.

In addition, the feature aging module guides age-progression in the image space such that synthesized aged faces can be utilized to enhance longitudinal face recognition performance of any face matcher without requiring any explicit training. For time lapses larger than 10 years (the missing child is found after 10 or more years), the proposed age-progression module improves the closed-set identification accuracy of FaceNet from 16.53% to 21.44% and CosFace from 60.72% to 66.12% on a child celebrity dataset, namely ITWCC.

In this paper, we take a very different perspective on the problem and ask, \"Can we instead identify latent properties by leveraging knowledge of the mechanisms that govern their evolution?\" We provide a complete characterization of the sources of non-identifiability as we vary knowledge about a set of possible mechanisms. In particular, we prove that if we know the exact mechanisms under which the latent properties evolve, then identification can be achieved up to any equivariances that are shared by the underlying mechanisms. We generalize this characterization to settings where we only know some hypothesis class over possible mechanisms, as well as settings where the mechanisms are stochastic. We demonstrate the power of this mechanism-based perspective by showing that we can leverage our results to generalize existing identifiable representation learning results.

{"text": "Title: Crafting, Communality, and Computing: Building on Existing Strengths To Support a Vulnerable Population\nAbstract: In Nepal, sex-trafficking survivors and the organizations that support them have limited resources to assist the survivors in their on-going journey towards reintegration. We take an asset-based approach wherein we identify and build on the strengths possessed by such groups. In this work, we present reflections from introducing a voice-annotated web application to a group of survivors. The web application tapped into and built upon two elements of pre-existing strengths possessed by the survivors -- the social bond between them and knowledge of crafting as taught to them by the organization. Our findings provide insight into the array of factors influencing how the survivors act in relation to one another as they created novel use practices and adapted the technology. Experience with the application seemed to open knowledge of computing as a potential source of strength.

{"text": "Title: Balancing Adaptability and Non-exploitability in Repeated Games\nAbstract: We study the problem of guaranteeing low regret in repeated games against an opponent with unknown membership in one of several classes. We add the constraint that our algorithm is non-exploitable, in that the opponent lacks an incentive to use an algorithm against which we cannot achieve rewards exceeding some \"fair\" value. Our solution is an expert algorithm (LAFF) that searches within a set of sub-algorithms that are optimal for each opponent class and uses a punishment policy upon detecting evidence of exploitation by the opponent. With benchmarks that depend on the opponent class, we show that LAFF has sublinear regret uniformly over the possible opponents, except exploitative ones, for which we guarantee that the opponent has linear regret. To our knowledge, this work is the first to provide guarantees for both regret and non-exploitability in multi-agent learning.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Dynamics of point-vortex systems near thermal equilibrium: relaxation or not?\nAbstract: This article is devoted to the long-time dynamics of point-vortex systems near thermal equilibrium and to the possible emergence of collisional relaxation. More precisely, we consider a tagged particle coupled to a large number of background particles that are initially at equilibrium, and we analyze its resulting slow dynamics. On the one hand, in the spirit of the Lenard-Balescu relaxation for plasmas, we establish in a generic setting the outset of the slow thermalization of the tagged particle. On the other hand, we show that a completely different phenomenology is also possible in some degenerate regime: the slow dynamics of the tagged particle then remains conservative and the thermalization no longer holds in a strict sense. We provide the first detailed description of this degenerate regime and of its mixing properties. Note that it is particularly delicate to handle due to statistical closure problems, which manifest themselves as a lack of self-adjointness of the effective Hamiltonian.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Interface spaces based on physics for multiscale mixed methods applied to flows in fractured-like porous media\nAbstract: It is well known that domain-decomposition-based multiscale mixed methods rely on interface spaces, defined on the skeleton of the decomposition, to connect the solution among the non-overlapping subdomains. Usual spaces, such as polynomial-based ones, cannot properly represent high-contrast channelized features such as fractures (high permeability) and barriers (low permeability) for flows in heterogeneous porous media. We propose here new interface spaces, which are based on physics, to deal with permeability fields in the simultaneous presence of fractures and barriers, accommodated respectively, by the pressure and flux spaces. Existing multiscale methods based on mixed formulations can take advantage of the proposed interface spaces, however, in order to present and test our results, we use the newly developed Multiscale Robin Coupled Method (MRCM) [Guiraldello, et al., J. Comput. Phys., 355 (2018) pp. 1-21], which generalizes most well-known multiscale mixed methods, and allows for the independent choice of the pressure and flux interface spaces. An adaptive version of the MRCM [Rocha, et al., J. Comput. Phys., 409 (2020), 109316] is considered that automatically selects the physics-based pressure space for fractured structures and the physics-based flux space for regions with barriers, resulting in a procedure with unprecedented accuracy. The features of the proposed approach are investigated through several numerical simulations of single-phase and two-phase flows, in different heterogeneous porous media. The adaptive MRCM combined with the interface spaces based on physics provides promising results for challenging problems with the simultaneous presence of fractures and barriers.", "field": "math", "label": 1}

Specifically, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework is developed for adaptive configuration within a parameterized unifying algorithmic form, which incorporates an abundance of decentralized first-order and second-order optimization algorithms. We exploit the local consensus and objective information to represent the regularities of problem instances and trace the solving progress, which constitute the states observed by a DRL agent. The framework is trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) on a number of practical problem instances of similar structures yet different problem data.

The RK collocation scheme converges to the nonlocal limit and also to the local limit as nonlocal interactions vanish. The stability is shown by comparing the collocation scheme with the standard Galerkin scheme using Fourier analysis. We then apply the RK collocation to the quasi-discrete peridynamic Navier equation and show its convergence to the correct local limit when the ratio between the nonlocal length scale and the discretization parameter is fixed. The analysis is carried out on a special family of rectilinear Cartesian grids for the RK collocation method with a designated kernel with finite support.

The proposed scheme utilizes Integer Forcing Linear Receiver (IFLR) at relay, which uses equations, i.e., linear integer-combinations of messages, to harness the intra-pair interference. Accordingly, we propose the design of mean squared error (MSE) based transceiver, including precoder and projection matrices for the relay and users, assuming that the perfect channel state information (CSI) is available. In this regards, in the multiple-access phase, we introduce two new MSE criteria for the related precoding and filter designs, i.e., the sum of the equations MSE (Sum-Equation MSE) and the maximum of the equations MSE (Max-Equation MSE), to exploit the equations in the relay. In addition, the convergence of the proposed criteria is proven as well. Moreover, in the broadcast phase, we use the two traditional MSE criteria, i.e. the sum of the users' mean squred errors (Sum MSE) and the maximum of the users' mean squared errors (Max MSE), to design the related precoding and filters for recovering relay's equations by the users. Then, we consider a more practical scenario with imperfect CSI. For this case, IFLR receiver is modified, and another transceiver design is proposed, which take into account the effect of channels estimation error. We evaluate the performance of our proposed strategy and compare the results with the conventional amplify-and-forward (AF) and denoise-and-forward (DF) strategies for the same scenario.

{"text": "Title: Neural Collapse for Cross-entropy Class-Imbalanced Learning with Unconstrained ReLU Feature Model\nAbstract: The current paradigm of training deep neural networks for classification tasks includes minimizing the empirical risk that pushes the training loss value towards zero, even after the training error has been vanished. In this terminal phase of training, it has been observed that the last-layer features collapse to their class-means and these class-means converge to the vertices of a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF). This phenomenon is termed as Neural Collapse (NC). To theoretically understand this phenomenon, recent works employ a simplified unconstrained feature model to prove that NC emerges at the global solutions of the training problem. However, when the training dataset is class-imbalanced, some NC properties will no longer be true. For example, the class-means geometry will skew away from the simplex ETF when the loss converges. In this paper, we generalize NC to imbalanced regime for cross-entropy loss under the unconstrained ReLU feature model. We prove that, while the within-class features collapse property still holds in this setting, the class-means will converge to a structure consisting of orthogonal vectors with different lengths. Furthermore, we find that the classifier weights are aligned to the scaled and centered class-means with scaling factors depend on the number of training samples of each class, which generalizes NC in the class-balanced setting.

This paper focuses on binary classification and proposes FairGridSearch, a novel framework for comparing fairness-enhancing models. FairGridSearch enables experimentation with different model parameter combinations and recommends the best one. The study applies FairGridSearch to three popular datasets (Adult, COMPAS, and German Credit) and analyzes the impacts of metric selection, base estimator choice, and classification threshold on model fairness. The results highlight the significance of selecting appropriate accuracy and fairness metrics for model evaluation. Additionally, different base estimators and classification threshold values affect the effectiveness of bias mitigation methods and fairness stability respectively, but the effects are not consistent across all datasets. Based on these findings, future research on fairness in machine learning should consider a broader range of factors when building fair models, going beyond bias mitigation methods alone.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Deep Recurrent Level Set for Segmenting Brain Tumors\nAbstract: Variational Level Set (VLS) has been a widely used method in medical segmentation. However, segmentation accuracy in the VLS method dramatically decreases when dealing with intervening factors such as lighting, shadows, colors, etc. Additionally, results are quite sensitive to initial settings and are highly dependent on the number of iterations. In order to address these limitations, the proposed method incorporates VLS into deep learning by defining a novel end-to-end trainable model called as Deep Recurrent Level Set (DRLS). The proposed DRLS consists of three layers, i.e, Convolutional layers, Deconvolutional layers with skip connections and LevelSet layers. Brain tumor segmentation is taken as an instant to illustrate the performance of the proposed DRLS. Convolutional layer learns visual representation of brain tumor at different scales. Since brain tumors occupy a small portion of the image, deconvolutional layers are designed with skip connections to obtain a high quality feature map. Level-Set Layer drives the contour towards the brain tumor. In each step, the Convolutional Layer is fed with the LevelSet map to obtain a brain tumor feature map. This in turn serves as input for the LevelSet layer in the next step. The experimental results have been obtained on BRATS2013, BRATS2015 and BRATS2017 datasets. The proposed DRLS model improves both computational time and segmentation accuracy when compared to the the classic VLS-based method.

{"text": "Title: Debiased Cross-modal Matching for Content-based Micro-video Background Music Recommendation\nAbstract: Micro-video background music recommendation is a complicated task where the matching degree between videos and uploader-selected background music is a major issue. However, the selection of the user-generated content (UGC) is biased caused by knowledge limitations and historical preferences among music of each uploader. In this paper, we propose a Debiased Cross-Modal (DebCM) matching model to alleviate the influence of such selection bias. Specifically, we design a teacher-student network to utilize the matching of segments of music videos, which is professional-generated content (PGC) with specialized music-matching techniques, to better alleviate the bias caused by insufficient knowledge of users. The PGC data is captured by a teacher network to guide the matching of uploader-selected UGC data of the student network by KL-based knowledge transfer. In addition, uploaders' personal preferences of music genres are identified as confounders that spuriously correlate music embeddings and background music selections, resulting in the learned recommender system to over-recommend music from the majority groups. To resolve such confounders in the UGC data of the student network, backdoor adjustment is utilized to deconfound the spurious correlation between music embeddings and prediction scores. We further utilize Monte Carlo (MC) estimator with batch-level average as the approximations to avoid integrating the entire confounder space calculated by the adjustment.

To the pair $(U,f)$ one can associate an infinite cyclic cover $U^f$, and (homology) Alexander modules are defined as the homology groups of this cover. In two recent works, the first of which is joint with Geske, Maxim and Wang, we developed two different ways to put a mixed Hodge structure on Alexander modules. Since they are not finite dimensional in general, each approach replaces the Alexander module by a different finite dimensional module: one of them takes the torsion submodule, the other takes finite dimensional quotients, and the constructions are not directly comparable. In this note, we show that both constructions are compatible, in the sense that the map from the torsion to the quotients is a mixed Hodge structure morphism.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: ETTR Bounds and Approximation Solutions of Blind Rendezvous Policies in Cognitive Radio Networks with Random Channel States\nAbstract: In this paper, we consider the multichannel rendezvous problem in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) where the probability that two users hopping on the same channel have a successful rendezvous is a function of channel states. The channel states are modeled by stochastic processes with joint distributions known to users. However, the exact state of a channel at any time is not observable. We first consider two channel models: (i) the fast time-varying channel model (where the channel states are assumed to be independent and identically distributed in each time slot), and (ii) the slow time-varying channel model (where the channel states remain unchanged over time). Among the classes of the blind rendezvous policies that randomly hop on channels according to certain channel selection probabilities, we show the optimal channel selection policy that minimizes the expected time-to-rendezvous (ETTR) is the single selection policy that hops on the ``best'' channel all the time in the fast time-varying channel model. However, for the slow time-varying channel model, it is much more difficult to find the optimal channel selection policy. By using the majorization ordering, we derive a lower bound and an upper bound for the ETTR under the assumption that the channel states are exchangeable random variables. Bases on these bounds, we then prove various approximation solutions. We then extend our results to general channel models where the joint distribution of the channel states is only assumed to be stationary in time.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Interacting stochastic processes on sparse random graphs\nAbstract: Large ensembles of stochastically evolving interacting particles describe phenomena in diverse fields including statistical physics, neuroscience, biology, and engineering. In such systems, the infinitesimal evolution of each particle depends only on its own state (or history) and the states (or histories) of neighboring particles with respect to an underlying, possibly random, interaction graph. While these high-dimensional processes are typically too complex to be amenable to exact analysis, their dynamics are quite well understood when the interaction graph is the complete graph. In this case, classical theorems show that in the limit as the number of particles goes to infinity, the dynamics of the empirical measure and the law of a typical particle coincide and can be characterized in terms of a much more tractable dynamical system of reduced dimension called the mean-field limit. In contrast, until recently not much was known about corresponding convergence results in the complementary case when the interaction graph is sparse (i.e., with uniformly bounded average degree). This article provides a brief survey of classical work and then describes recent progress on the sparse regime that relies on a combination of techniques from random graph theory, Markov random fields, and stochastic analysis. The article concludes by discussing ramifications for applications and posing several open problems.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: EPA: Neural Collapse Inspired Robust Out-of-Distribution Detector\nAbstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the security of neural networks.

However, the comprehensive characteristics of the ID subspace still leave under-explored.

{"text": "Title: On Error and Compression Rates for Prototype Rules\nAbstract: We study the close interplay between error and compression in the non-parametric multiclass classification setting in terms of prototype learning rules. We focus in particular on a recently proposed compression-based learning rule termed OptiNet (Kontorovich, Sabato, and Urner 2016; Kontorovich, Sabato, and Weiss 2017; Hanneke et al. 2021). Beyond its computational merits, this rule has been recently shown to be universally consistent in any metric instance space that admits a universally consistent rule--the first learning algorithm known to enjoy this property. However, its error and compression rates have been left open. Here we derive such rates in the case where instances reside in Euclidean space under commonly posed smoothness and tail conditions on the data distribution. We first show that OptiNet achieves non-trivial compression rates while enjoying near minimax-optimal error rates. We then proceed to study a novel general compression scheme for further compressing prototype rules that locally adapts to the noise level without sacrificing accuracy. Applying it to OptiNet, we show that under a geometric margin condition, further gain in the compression rate is achieved.

{"text": "Title: Compositing with 2D Vector Fields by using Shape Maps that can represent Inconsistent, Impossible, and Incoherent Shapes\nAbstract: In this paper, we present a new compositing approach to obtain stylized reflections and refractions with a simple control. Our approach does not require any mask or separate 3D rendering. Moreover, only one additional image is sufficient to obtain a composited image with convincing qualitative reflection and refraction effects. We have also developed linearized methods that are easy to compute. Although these methods do not directly correspond to the underlying physical phenomena of reflection and refraction, they can provide results that are visually similar to realistic 3D rendering. The main advantage of this approach is the ability to treat images as ``mock-3D'' shapes that can be inserted into any digital paint system without any significant structural change. The core of our approach is the shape map, which encodes 2D shape and thickness information for all visible points of an image of a shape. This information does not have to be complete or consistent to obtain interesting composites. In particular, the shape maps allow us to represent impossible and incoherent shapes with 2D non-conservative vector fields.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Fast Discrete Linear Canonical Transform Based on CM-CC-CM Decomposition and FFT\nAbstract: In this paper, a discrete LCT (DLCT) irrelevant to the sampling periods and without oversampling operation is developed. This DLCT is based on the well-known CM-CC-CM decomposition, that is, implemented by two discrete chirp multiplications (CMs) and one discrete chirp convolution (CC). This decomposition doesn't use any scaling operation which will change the sampling period or cause the interpolation error. Compared with previous works, DLCT calculated by direct summation and DLCT based on center discrete dilated Hermite functions (CDDHFs), the proposed method implemented by FFTs has much lower computational complexity. The relation between the proposed DLCT and the continuous LCT is also derived to approximate the samples of the continuous LCT. Simulation results show that the proposed method somewhat outperforms the CDDHFs-based method in the approximation accuracy. Besides, the proposed method has approximate additivity property with error as small as the CDDHFs-based method. Most importantly, the proposed method has perfect reversibility, which doesn't hold in many existing DLCTs. With this property, it is unnecessary to develop the inverse DLCT additionally because it can be replaced by the forward DLCT.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

Moreover, when solving the capacity constrained multi-marginal optimal transport (CMOT) problem (a special case of our LP problem), our iEPPA is able to bypass the underlying numerical instability issues that often appear in the popular entropic regularization approach, since our algorithm does not require the proximal parameter to be very small in order to obtain an accurate approximate solution.

{"text": "Title: Knowledge-based XAI through CBR: There is more to explanations than models can tell\nAbstract: The underlying hypothesis of knowledge-based explainable artificial intelligence is the data required for data-centric artificial intelligence agents (e.g., neural networks) are less diverse in contents than the data required to explain the decisions of such agents to humans. The idea is that a classifier can attain high accuracy using data that express a phenomenon from one perspective whereas the audience of explanations can entail multiple stakeholders and span diverse perspectives. We hence propose to use domain knowledge to complement the data used by agents. We formulate knowledge-based explainable artificial intelligence as a supervised data classification problem aligned with the CBR methodology. In this formulation, the inputs are case problems composed of both the inputs and outputs of the data-centric agent and case solutions, the outputs, are explanation categories obtained from domain knowledge and subject matter experts. This formulation does not typically lead to an accurate classification, preventing the selection of the correct explanation category.

{"text": "Title: A network-level transport model of tau progression in the Alzheimer's brain\nAbstract: One of the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation and spread of toxic aggregates of tau protein. The progression of AD tau pathology is thought to be highly stereotyped, which is in part due to the fact that tau can spread between regions via the white matter tracts that connect them. Mathematically, this phenomenon has been described using models of \"network diffusion\", where the rate of spread of tau between brain regions is proportional to its concentration gradient and the amount of white matter between them. Although these models can robustly predict the progression of pathology in a wide variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD, an under explored aspect of tau spreading is that it is governed not simply by diffusion but also active transport along axonal microtubules. Spread can therefore take on a directional bias, resulting in distinct patterns of deposition, but current models struggle to capture this phenomenon. Recently, we have developed a mathematical model of the axonal transport of toxic tau proteins that takes into account the effects tau exerts on the molecular motors. Here we describe and implement a macroscopic version of this model, which we call the Network Transport Model (NTM). A key feature of this model is that, while it predicts tau dynamics at a regional level, it is parameterized in terms of only microscopic processes such as aggregation and transport rates; that is, differences in brain-wide tau progression can be explained by its microscopic properties. We provide numerical evidence that, as with the two-neuron model that the NTM extends, there are distinct and rich dynamics with respect to the overall rate of spread and the staging of pathology when we simulated the NTM on the hippocampal subnetwork. The theoretical insights provided by the NTM have broad implications for understanding AD pathophysiology more generally.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Variational Autoencoders Without the Variation\nAbstract: Variational autoencdoers (VAE) are a popular approach to generative modelling. However, exploiting the capabilities of VAEs in practice can be difficult. Recent work on regularised and entropic autoencoders have begun to explore the potential, for generative modelling, of removing the variational approach and returning to the classic deterministic autoencoder (DAE) with additional novel regularisation methods. In this paper we empirically explore the capability of DAEs for image generation without additional novel methods and the effect of the implicit regularisation and smoothness of large networks. We find that DAEs can be used successfully for image generation without additional loss terms, and that many of the useful properties of VAEs can arise implicitly from sufficiently large convolutional encoders and decoders when trained on CIFAR-10 and CelebA.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Partial classification of the large-time behavior of solutions to cubic nonlinear Schr√∂dinger systems\nAbstract: In this paper, we study the large-time behavior of small solutions to the standard form of the systems of 1D cubic nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equations consisting of two components and possessing a coercive mass-like conserved quantity. The cubic nonlinearity is known to be critical in one space dimension in view of the large-time behavior. By employing the result by Katayama and Sakoda, one can obtain the large-time behavior of the solution if we can integrate the corresponding ODE system. We introduce an integration scheme suited to the system. The key idea is to rewrite the ODE system, which is cubic, as a quadratic system of quadratic quantities of the original unknown. By using this technique, we described the large-time behavior of solutions in terms of elementary functions and the Jacobi elliptic functions for several examples of standard systems.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

Data provenance extracts from this computation an abstraction of the manner in which its result depends on the data items that describe the model. Previous work on provenance was, to a large extent, restricted to the negation-free fragment of first-order logic and showed how provenance abstractions can be usefully described as elements of commutative semirings --- most generally as multivariate polynomials with positive integer coefficients. In this paper we introduce a novel approach to dealing with negation and a corresponding commutative semiring of polynomials with dual indeterminates. These polynomials are used to perform reverse provenance analysis, i.e., finding models that satisfy various properties under given provenance tracking assumptions.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: On the connected (sub)partition polytope\nAbstract: Let $k$ be a positive integer and let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices. A connected $k$-subpartition of $G$ is a collection of $k$ pairwise disjoint sets (a.k.a. classes) of vertices in $G$ such that each set induces a connected subgraph. The connected $k$-partition polytope of $G$, denoted by $P(G,k)$, is defined as the convex hull of the incidence vectors of all connected $k$-subpartitions of $G$. Many applications arising in off-shore oil-drilling, forest planning, image processing, cluster analysis, political districting, police patrolling, and biology are modeled in terms of finding connected (sub)partitions of a graph. This study focus on the facial structure of $P(G,k)$ and the computational complexity of the corresponding separation problems. We first propose a set of valid inequalities having non-null coefficients associated with a single class that extends and generalizes the ones in the literature of related problems, show sufficient conditions for these inequalities to be facet-defining, and design a polynomial-time separation algorithm for them. We also devise two sets of inequalities that consider multiple classes, prove when they define facets, and study the computational complexity of associated separation problems.", "field": "math", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Non-Atomic Arbitrage in Decentralized Finance\nAbstract: The prevalence of maximal extractable value (MEV) in the Ethereum ecosystem has led to a characterization of the latter as a dark forest. Studies of MEV have thus far largely been restricted to purely on-chain MEV, i.e., sandwich attacks, cyclic arbitrage, and liquidations. In this work, we shed light on the prevalence of non-atomic arbitrage on decentralized exchanges (DEXes) on the Ethereum blockchain. Importantly, non-atomic arbitrage exploits price differences between DEXes on the Ethereum blockchain as well as exchanges outside the Ethereum blockchain (i.e., centralized exchanges or DEXes on other blockchains). Thus, non-atomic arbitrage is a type of MEV that involves actions on and off the Ethereum blockchain. In our study of non-atomic arbitrage, we uncover that more than a fourth of the volume on Ethereum's biggest five DEXes from the merge until 31 October 2023 can likely be attributed to this type of MEV. We further highlight that only eleven searchers are responsible for more than 80% of the identified non-atomic arbitrage volume sitting at a staggering 137 billion US$ and draw a connection between the centralization of the block construction market and non-atomic arbitrage. Finally, we discuss the security implications of these high-value transactions that account for more than 10% of Ethereum's total block value and outline possible mitigations.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Proven Distributed Memory Parallelization of Particle Methods\nAbstract: We provide a mathematically proven parallelization scheme for particle methods on distributed-memory computer systems. Particle methods are a versatile and widely used class of algorithms for computer simulations and numerical predictions in various applications, ranging from continuum fluid dynamics and granular flows, using methods such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and Discrete Element Methods (DEM) to Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations in molecular modeling. Particle methods naturally lend themselves to implementation on parallel-computing hardware. So far, however, a mathematical proof of correctness and equivalence to sequential implementations was only available for shared-memory parallelism. Here, we leverage a formal definition of the algorithmic class of particle methods to provide a proven parallelization scheme for distributed-memory computers. We prove that these parallelized particle methods on distributed memory computers are formally equivalent to their sequential counterpart for a well-defined class of particle methods. Notably, the here analyzed parallelization scheme is well-known and commonly used. Our analysis is, therefore, of immediate practical relevance to existing and new parallel software implementations of particle methods and places them on solid theoretical grounds.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

In this work, we assume linear continuum elasticity. We show results for two-dimensional (2D) plane strain problem and then we proceed to apply the same techniques for a three-dimensional (3D) problem. As for the training data we use the solution based on the finite element method. We rigorously show that PINN models are accurate, robust and computationally efficient, especially as a surrogate model for material identification problems. Also, we employ state-of-the-art techniques from the PINN literature which are an improvement to the vanilla implementation of PINN.

{"text": "Title: Speed Partitioning for Indexing Moving Objects\nAbstract: Indexing moving objects has been extensively studied in the past decades. Moving objects, such as vehicles and mobile device users, usually exhibit some patterns on their velocities, which can be utilized for velocity-based partitioning to improve performance of the indexes. Existing velocity-based partitioning techniques rely on some kinds of heuristics rather than analytically calculate the optimal solution. In this paper, we propose a novel speed partitioning technique based on a formal analysis over speed values of the moving objects. We first show that speed partitioning will significantly reduce the search space expansion which has direct impacts on query performance of the indexes. Next we formulate the optimal speed partitioning problem based on search space expansion analysis and then compute the optimal solution using dynamic programming. We then build the partitioned indexing system where queries are duplicated and processed in each index partition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method dramatically improves the performance of indexes for moving objects and outperforms other state-of-the-art velocity-based partitioning approaches.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Hierarchical Over-the-Air Federated Learning with Awareness of Interference and Data Heterogeneity\nAbstract: When implementing hierarchical federated learning over wireless networks, scalability assurance and the ability to handle both interference and device data heterogeneity are crucial. This work introduces a learning method designed to address these challenges, along with a scalable transmission scheme that efficiently uses a single wireless resource through over-the-air computation. To provide resistance against data heterogeneity, we employ gradient aggregations. Meanwhile, the impact of interference is minimized through optimized receiver normalizing factors. For this, we model a multi-cluster wireless network using stochastic geometry, and characterize the mean squared error of the aggregation estimations as a function of the network parameters. We show that despite the interference and the data heterogeneity, the proposed scheme achieves high learning accuracy and can significantly outperform the conventional hierarchical algorithm.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Multimodal Sampling via Approximate Symmetries\nAbstract: Sampling from multimodal distributions is a challenging task in scientific computing. When a distribution has an exact symmetry between the modes, direct jumps among them can accelerate the samplings significantly. However, the distributions from most applications do not have exact symmetries. This paper considers the distributions with approximate symmetries. We first construct an exactly symmetric reference distribution from the target one by averaging over the group orbit associated with the approximate symmetry. Next, we can apply the multilevel Monte Carlo methods by constructing a continuation path between the reference and target distributions. We discuss how to implement these steps with annealed importance sampling and tempered transitions. Compared with traditional multilevel methods, the proposed approach can be more effective since the reference and target distributions are much closer. Numerical results of the Ising models are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

However, correct use of LF relies on nontrivial metatheoretic developments such as proofs of correctness of decision procedures for LF's judgments. Although detailed informal proofs of these properties have been published, they have not been formally verified in a theorem prover. We have formalized these properties within Isabelle/HOL using the Nominal Datatype Package, closely following a recent article by Harper and Pfenning. In the process, we identified and resolved a gap in one of the proofs and a small number of minor lacunae in others. We also formally derive a version of the type checking algorithm from which Isabelle/HOL can generate executable code.

Our goals are twofold: to better understand the limitations of the confidentiality of HTTPS, and to explore benign uses of traffic analysis such as application troubleshooting and malware detection that could replace HTTPS interception and static private keys in some scenarios. We found that our techniques improve the efficacy of malware detection, but they do not enable more powerful website fingerprinting attacks against Tor. Our broader set of results raises concerns about the confidentiality goals of TLS relative to a user's expectation of privacy, warranting future research. We apply our methods to the semantics of both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 on data collected from automated runs of Firefox 58.0, Chrome 63.0, and Tor Browser 7.0.11 in a lab setting, and from applications running in a malware sandbox. We obtain ground truth plaintext for a diverse set of applications from the malware sandbox by extracting the key material needed for decryption from RAM post-execution.

We propose that such systems are modeled as coalgebras with a finitely generated carrier for an endofunctor on a locally finitely presentable category. Their behaviour gives rise to a new fixpoint of the coalgebraic type functor called locally finite fixpoint (LFF). We prove that if the given endofunctor preserves monomorphisms then the LFF always exists and is a subcoalgebra of the final coalgebra (unlike the rational fixpoint previously studied by Ad\\'amek, Milius and Velebil). Moreover, we show that the LFF is characterized by two universal properties: 1. as the final locally finitely generated coalgebra, and 2. as the initial fg-iterative algebra. As instances of the LFF we first obtain the known instances of the rational fixpoint, e.g. regular languages, rational streams and formal power-series, regular trees etc. And we obtain a number of new examples, e.g. (realtime deterministic resp. non-deterministic) context-free languages, constructively S-algebraic formal power-series (and any other instance of the generalized powerset construction by Silva, Bonchi, Bonsangue, and Rutten) and the monad of Courcelle's algebraic trees.", "field": "math", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Evolutionary Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Constrained Multi-Objective Optimization with Unknown Constraints\nAbstract: Constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs) pervade real-world applications in science, engineering, and design. Constraint violation has been a building block in designing evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms for solving constrained multi-objective optimization problems. However, in certain scenarios, constraint functions might be unknown or inadequately defined, making constraint violation unattainable and potentially misleading for conventional constrained evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms. To address this issue, we present the first of its kind evolutionary optimization framework, inspired by the principles of the alternating direction method of multipliers that decouples objective and constraint functions. This framework tackles CMOPs with unknown constraints by reformulating the original problem into an additive form of two subproblems, each of which is allotted a dedicated evolutionary population. Notably, these two populations operate towards complementary evolutionary directions during their optimization processes. In order to minimize discrepancy, their evolutionary directions alternate, aiding the discovery of feasible solutions. Comparative experiments conducted against five state-of-the-art constrained evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms, on 120 benchmark test problem instances with varying properties, as well as two real-world engineering optimization problems, demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed framework. Its salient features include faster convergence and enhanced resilience to various Pareto front shapes.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

There is equality in either if, and only if, $K$ is a $n$-dimensional simplex.

As such, the considered fluid may go through transitions between three of the following regimes: it can flow as a Bingham fluid for a specific value of the temperature, while it can behave as the Navier-Stokes fluid for another value of the temperature or, for yet another temperature, it can respond as the Euler fluid until a certain activation initiates the response of the Navier-Stokes fluid. At the same time, we regard a generalized threshold slip on the boundary that also may go through various regimes continuously with the temperature.

Although the uncertainties of the workers can be addressed by the standard Combinatorial Multi-Armed Bandit (CMAB) framework in existing proposals through a trade-off between exploration and exploitation, we may not have sufficient budget to enable the trade-off among the individual workers, especially when the number of the workers is huge while the budget is limited. Moreover, the standard CMAB usually assumes the workers always stay in the system, whereas the workers may join in or depart from the system over time, such that what we have learnt for an individual worker cannot be applied after the worker leaves. To address the above challenging issues, in this paper, we first propose an off-line Context-Aware CMAB-based Incentive (CACI) mechanism. We innovate in leveraging the exploration-exploitation trade-off in an elaborately partitioned context space instead of the individual workers, to effectively incentivize the massive unknown workers with a very limited budget. We also extend the above basic idea to the on-line setting where unknown workers may join in or depart from the systems dynamically, and propose an on-line version of the CACI mechanism. We perform rigorous theoretical analysis to reveal the upper bounds on the regrets of our CACI mechanisms and to prove their truthfulness and individual rationality, respectively.

Constructor's goal is to build as many copies of $H$ as she can, while Blocker attempts to stop this. The game ends once there are no more edges that Constructor can claim. The score $g(n,H,F)$ of the game is the number of copies of $H$ in Constructor's graph at the end of the game, when both players play optimally and Constructor plays first. In this paper, we extend results of Patk\\'os, Stojakovi\\'c and Vizer on $g(n, H, F)$ to many pairs of $H$ and $F$: We determine $g(n, H, F)$ when $H=K_r$ and $\\chi(F)>r$, also when both $H$ and $F$ are odd cycles, using Szemer\\'edi's Regularity Lemma.

{"text": "Title: Generalized Modularity Embedding: a General Framework for Network Embedding\nAbstract: The network embedding problem aims to map nodes that are similar to each other to vectors in a Euclidean space that are close to each other. Like centrality analysis (ranking) and community detection, network embedding is in general considered as an ill-posed problem, and its solution may depend on a person's view on this problem. In this book chapter, we adopt the framework of sampled graphs that treat a person's view as a sampling method for a network. The modularity for a sampled graph, called the generalized modularity in the book chapter, is a similarity matrix that has a specific probabilistic interpretation. One of the main contributions of this book chapter is to propose using the generalized modularity matrix for network embedding and show that the network embedding problem can be treated as a trace maximization problem like the community detection problem. Our generalized modularity embedding approach is very general and flexible. In particular, we show that the Laplacian eigenmaps is a special case of our generalized modularity embedding approach. Also, we show that dimensionality reduction can be done by using a particular sampled graph. Various experiments are conducted on real datasets to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: k-Winners-Take-All Ensemble Neural Network\nAbstract: Ensembling is one approach that improves the performance of a neural network by combining a number of independent neural networks, usually by either averaging or summing up their individual outputs. We modify this ensembling approach by training the sub-networks concurrently instead of independently. This concurrent training of sub-networks leads them to cooperate with each other, and we refer to them as \"cooperative ensemble\". Meanwhile, the mixture-of-experts approach improves a neural network performance by dividing up a given dataset to its sub-networks. It then uses a gating network that assigns a specialization to each of its sub-networks called \"experts\". We improve on these aforementioned ways for combining a group of neural networks by using a k-Winners-Take-All (kWTA) activation function, that acts as the combination method for the outputs of each sub-network in the ensemble. We refer to this proposed model as \"kWTA ensemble neural networks\" (kWTA-ENN). With the kWTA activation function, the losing neurons of the sub-networks are inhibited while the winning neurons are retained. This results in sub-networks having some form of specialization but also sharing knowledge with one another. We compare our approach with the cooperative ensemble and mixture-of-experts, where we used a feed-forward neural network with one hidden layer having 100 neurons as the sub-network architecture. Our approach yields a better performance compared to the baseline models, reaching the following test accuracies on benchmark datasets: 98.34% on MNIST, 88.06% on Fashion-MNIST, 91.56% on KMNIST, and 95.97% on WDBC.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Faster Projection-Free Augmented Lagrangian Methods via Weak Proximal Oracle\nAbstract: This paper considers a convex composite optimization problem with affine constraints, which includes problems that take the form of minimizing a smooth convex objective function over the intersection of (simple) convex sets, or regularized with multiple (simple) functions. Motivated by high-dimensional applications in which exact projection/proximal computations are not tractable, we propose a \\textit{projection-free} augmented Lagrangian-based method, in which primal updates are carried out using a \\textit{weak proximal oracle} (WPO). In an earlier work, WPO was shown to be more powerful than the standard \\textit{linear minimization oracle} (LMO) that underlies conditional gradient-based methods (aka Frank-Wolfe methods). Moreover, WPO is computationally tractable for many high-dimensional problems of interest, including those motivated by recovery of low-rank matrices and tensors, and optimization over polytopes which admit efficient LMOs. The main result of this paper shows that under a certain curvature assumption (which is weaker than strong convexity), our WPO-based algorithm achieves an ergodic rate of convergence of $O(1/T)$ for both the objective residual and feasibility gap. This result, to the best of our knowledge, improves upon the $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ rate for existing LMO-based projection-free methods for this class of problems.

The presence of the Carleman Weight Function (CWF) in the resulting regularization functional ensures the global convergence of the gradient descent method of the minimization of this functional to the true solution of the CIP, as long as the noise level tends to zero. The CWF is the function, which is used as the weight in the Carleman estimate for the corresponding Partial Differential Operator. Numerical studies demonstrate an accurate reconstruction of unknown coefficients as well as S,I,R functions inside of that city. As a by-product, uniqueness theorem for this CIP is proven.

{"text": "Title: Category-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation with Flexible Vector-Based Rotation Representation\nAbstract: In this paper, we propose a novel 3D graph convolution based pipeline for category-level 6D pose and size estimation from monocular RGB-D images. The proposed method leverages an efficient 3D data augmentation and a novel vector-based decoupled rotation representation. Specifically, we first design an orientation-aware autoencoder with 3D graph convolution for latent feature learning. The learned latent feature is insensitive to point shift and size thanks to the shift and scale-invariance properties of the 3D graph convolution. Then, to efficiently decode the rotation information from the latent feature, we design a novel flexible vector-based decomposable rotation representation that employs two decoders to complementarily access the rotation information. The proposed rotation representation has two major advantages: 1) decoupled characteristic that makes the rotation estimation easier; 2) flexible length and rotated angle of the vectors allow us to find a more suitable vector representation for specific pose estimation task. Finally, we propose a 3D deformation mechanism to increase the generalization ability of the pipeline. Extensive experiments show that the proposed pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance on category-level tasks. Further, the experiments demonstrate that the proposed rotation representation is more suitable for the pose estimation tasks than other rotation representations.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

In this paper, we present the first certified backdoor detector (CBD), which is based on a novel, adjustable conformal prediction scheme based on our proposed statistic local dominant probability. For any classifier under inspection, CBD provides 1) a detection inference, 2) the condition under which the attacks are guaranteed to be detectable for the same classification domain, and 3) a probabilistic upper bound for the false positive rate. Our theoretical results show that attacks with triggers that are more resilient to test-time noise and have smaller perturbation magnitudes are more likely to be detected with guarantees. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets considering various backdoor types, such as BadNet, CB, and Blend.

{"text": "Title: Starling: An I/O-Efficient Disk-Resident Graph Index Framework for High-Dimensional Vector Similarity Search on Data Segment\nAbstract: High-dimensional vector similarity search (HVSS) is receiving a spotlight as a powerful tool for various data science and AI applications. As vector data grows larger, in-memory indexes become extremely expensive because they necessitate substantial expansion of main memory resources. One possible solution is to use disk-based implementation, which stores and searches vector data in high-performance devices like NVMe SSDs. However, HVSS for data segments is still challenging in vector databases, where one machine has multiple segments for system features (like scaling) purposes. In this setting, each segment has limited memory and disk space, so HVSS on the data segment needs to balance accuracy, efficiency, and space cost. Existing disk-based methods are sub-optimal because they do not consider all these requirements together. In this paper, we present Starling, an I/O-efficient disk-resident graph index framework that optimizes data layout and search strategy in the segment. It has two main components: (1) a data layout that includes an in-memory navigation graph and a reordered disk-based graph with locality enhancement, which reduces the search path length and disk bandwidth wastage; and (2) a block search strategy that minimizes expensive disk I/Os when executing a vector query. We conduct extensive experiments to verify Starling's effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability. On a data segment with 2GB memory and 10GB disk capacity, Starling can maintain up to 33 million vectors in 128 dimensions, and serve HVSS with more than 0.9 average precision and top-10 recall rate, and latency of under 1 millisecond.

In this paper, we propose a novel marginal debiased network (MDN) to learn debiased representations. More specifically, a marginal softmax loss (MSL) is designed by introducing the idea of margin penalty into the fairness problem, which assigns a larger margin for bias-conflicting samples (data without spurious correlations) than for bias-aligned ones, so as to deemphasize the spurious correlations and improve generalization on unbiased test criteria. To determine the margins, our MDN is optimized through a meta learning framework. We propose a meta equalized loss (MEL) to perceive the model fairness, and adaptively update the margin parameters by metaoptimization which requires the trained model guided by the optimal margins should minimize MEL computed on an unbiased meta-validation set.

While there are several approaches for testing and analysing them in high-fidelity simulators, ADSs may still encounter additional critical scenarios beyond those covered once they are deployed on real roads. An additional level of confidence can be established by monitoring and enforcing critical properties when the ADS is running. Existing work, however, is only able to monitor simple safety properties (e.g., avoidance of collisions) and is limited to blunt enforcement mechanisms such as hitting the emergency brakes. In this work, we propose REDriver, a general and modular approach to runtime enforcement, in which users can specify a broad range of properties (e.g., national traffic laws) in a specification language based on signal temporal logic (STL). REDriver monitors the planned trajectory of the ADS based on a quantitative semantics of STL, and uses a gradient-driven algorithm to repair the trajectory when a violation of the specification is likely. We implemented REDriver for two versions of Apollo (i.e., a popular ADS), and subjected it to a benchmark of violations of Chinese traffic laws.

This situation where the task executors may delay their task submission is termed as procrastination in behavioural economics. In many applications, these late submission of tasks may be problematic for task requesters. In literature, how to prevent this procrastination within the deadline is not addressed in crowdsourcing scenario. However, in a bipartite graph setting one procrastination aware scheduling is proposed but balanced job distribution in different slots (also termed as schedules) is not considered there. In this paper, a procrastination aware scheduling of jobs is proliferated by proposing an (randomized) algorithm in crowdsourcing scenario (also applicable in mobile and spatial crowdsourcing). Our algorithm ensures that balancing of jobs in different schedules are maintained. Our scheme is compared with the existing algorithm through extensive simulation and in terms of balancing effect, our proposed algorithm outperforms the existing one.

To address this issue, this paper aims to reduce the modality discrepancy from the frequency domain perspective. Specifically, we propose a novel Frequency Domain Nuances Mining (FDNM) method to explore the cross-modality frequency domain information, which mainly includes an amplitude guided phase (AGP) module and an amplitude nuances mining (ANM) module.

Unfortunately, resetting the environment to its initial state after each trial requires substantial amount of human supervision and extensive instrumentation of the environment which defeats the goal of autonomous acquisition of complex behaviors. In this work, we propose Value-accelerated Persistent Reinforcement Learning (VaPRL), which generates a curriculum of initial states such that the agent can bootstrap on the success of easier tasks to efficiently learn harder tasks. The agent also learns to reach the initial states proposed by the curriculum, minimizing the reliance on human interventions into the learning.

{"text": "Title: Not all Minorities are Equal: Empty-Class-Aware Distillation for Heterogeneous Federated Learning\nAbstract: Data heterogeneity, characterized by disparities in local data distribution across clients, poses a significant challenge in federated learning. Substantial efforts have been devoted to addressing the heterogeneity in local label distribution. As minority classes suffer from worse accuracy due to overfitting on local imbalanced data, prior methods often incorporate class-balanced learning techniques during local training. Despite the improved mean accuracy across all classes, we observe that empty classes-referring to categories absent from a client's data distribution-are still not well recognized. This paper introduces FedED, a novel approach in heterogeneous federated learning that integrates both empty-class distillation and logit suppression simultaneously. Specifically, empty-class distillation leverages knowledge distillation during local training on each client to retain essential information related to empty classes from the global model. Moreover, logit suppression directly penalizes network logits for non-label classes, effectively addressing misclassifications in minority classes that may be biased toward majority classes.

This method, called slot-guided Volumetric Object Radiance Fields (sVORF), composes volumetric object radiance fields with object slots as a guidance to implement unsupervised 3D scene decomposition. Specifically, sVORF obtains object slots from a single image via a transformer module, maps these slots to volumetric object radiance fields with a hypernetwork and composes object radiance fields with the guidance of object slots at a 3D location. Moreover, sVORF significantly reduces memory requirement due to small-sized pixel rendering during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by showing top results in scene decomposition and generation tasks of complex synthetic datasets (e.g., Room-Diverse). Furthermore, we also confirm the potential of sVORF to segment objects in real-world scenes (e.g., the LLFF dataset). We hope our approach can provide preliminary understanding of the physical world and help ease future research in 3D object-centric representation learning.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Mining Fine-Grained Image-Text Alignment for Zero-Shot Captioning via Text-Only Training\nAbstract: Image captioning aims at generating descriptive and meaningful textual descriptions of images, enabling a broad range of vision-language applications. Prior works have demonstrated that harnessing the power of Contrastive Image Language Pre-training (CLIP) offers a promising approach to achieving zero-shot captioning, eliminating the need for expensive caption annotations. However, the widely observed modality gap in the latent space of CLIP harms the performance of zero-shot captioning by breaking the alignment between paired image-text features. To address this issue, we conduct an analysis on the CLIP latent space which leads to two findings. Firstly, we observe that the CLIP's visual feature of image subregions can achieve closer proximity to the paired caption due to the inherent information loss in text descriptions. In addition, we show that the modality gap between a paired image-text can be empirically modeled as a zero-mean Gaussian distribution. Motivated by the findings, we propose a novel zero-shot image captioning framework with text-only training to reduce the modality gap. In particular, we introduce a subregion feature aggregation to leverage local region information, which produces a compact visual representation for matching text representation. Moreover, we incorporate a noise injection and CLIP reranking strategy to boost captioning performance. We also extend our framework to build a zero-shot VQA pipeline, demonstrating its generality. Through extensive experiments on common captioning and VQA datasets such as MSCOCO, Flickr30k and VQAV2, we show that our method achieves remarkable performance improvements.

This problem was exactly, albeit non-rigorously solved by Ivan Kostov in 2000 using matrix integral techniques. We convert Kostov's work to a combinatorial argument involving functional equations coming from recursive decompositions of the maps, which we solve rigorously using complex analysis. We then investigate modular properties of the solution, which lead to simplifications in certain special cases.

{"text": "Title: Learning Discretized Neural Networks under Ricci Flow\nAbstract: In this paper, we study Discretized Neural Networks (DNNs) composed of low-precision weights and activations, which suffer from either infinite or zero gradients due to the non-differentiable discrete function during training. Most training-based DNNs in such scenarios employ the standard Straight-Through Estimator (STE) to approximate the gradient w.r.t. discrete values. However, the use of STE introduces the problem of gradient mismatch, arising from perturbations in the approximated gradient. To address this problem, this paper reveals that this mismatch can be interpreted as a metric perturbation in a Riemannian manifold, viewed through the lens of duality theory. Building on information geometry, we construct the Linearly Nearly Euclidean (LNE) manifold for DNNs, providing a background for addressing perturbations. By introducing a partial differential equation on metrics, i.e., the Ricci flow, we establish the dynamical stability and convergence of the LNE metric with the $L^2$-norm perturbation. In contrast to previous perturbation theories with convergence rates in fractional powers, the metric perturbation under the Ricci flow exhibits exponential decay in the LNE manifold. Experimental results across various datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior and more stable performance for DNNs compared to other representative training-based methods.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Radio Map-Based Spectrum Sharing for Joint Communication and Sensing\nAbstract: The sixth-generation (6G) network is expected to provide both communication and sensing (C&S) services. However, spectrum scarcity poses a major challenge to the harmonious coexistence of C&S systems. Without effective cooperation, the interference resulting from spectrum sharing impairs the performance of both systems. This paper addresses C&S interference within a distributed network. Different from traditional schemes that require pilot-based high-frequency interactions between C&S systems, we introduce a third party named the radio map to provide the large-scale channel state information (CSI). With large-scale CSI, we optimize the transmit power of C&S systems to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the radar detection, while meeting the ergodic rate requirement of the interfered user. Given the non-convexity of both the objective and constraint, we employ the techniques of auxiliary-function-based scaling and fraction programming for simplification. Subsequently, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve this problem. Simulation results collaborate our idea that the extrinsic information, i.e., positions and surroundings, is effective to decouple C&S interference.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Generative Optimization Networks for Memory Efficient Data Generation\nAbstract: In standard generative deep learning models, such as autoencoders or GANs, the size of the parameter set is proportional to the complexity of the generated data distribution. A significant challenge is to deploy resource-hungry deep learning models in devices with limited memory to prevent system upgrade costs. To combat this, we propose a novel framework called generative optimization networks (GON) that is similar to GANs, but does not use a generator, significantly reducing its memory footprint. GONs use a single discriminator network and run optimization in the input space to generate new data samples, achieving an effective compromise between training time and memory consumption. GONs are most suited for data generation problems in limited memory settings. Here we illustrate their use for the problem of anomaly detection in memory-constrained edge devices arising from attacks or intrusion events. Specifically, we use a GON to calculate a reconstruction-based anomaly score for input time-series windows. Experiments on a Raspberry-Pi testbed with two existing and a new suite of datasets show that our framework gives up to 32% higher detection F1 scores and 58% lower memory consumption, with only 5% higher training overheads compared to the state-of-the-art.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Thread With Caution: Proactively Helping Users Assess and Deescalate Tension in Their Online Discussions\nAbstract: Incivility remains a major challenge for online discussion platforms, to such an extent that even conversations between well-intentioned users can often derail into uncivil behavior. Traditionally, platforms have relied on moderators to -- with or without algorithmic assistance -- take corrective actions such as removing comments or banning users. In this work we propose a complementary paradigm that directly empowers users by proactively enhancing their awareness about existing tension in the conversation they are engaging in and actively guides them as they are drafting their replies to avoid further escalation. As a proof of concept for this paradigm, we design an algorithmic tool that provides such proactive information directly to users, and conduct a user study in a popular discussion platform. Through a mixed methods approach combining surveys with a randomized controlled experiment, we uncover qualitative and quantitative insights regarding how the participants utilize and react to this information. Most participants report finding this proactive paradigm valuable, noting that it helps them to identify tension that they may have otherwise missed and prompts them to further reflect on their own replies and to revise them. These effects are corroborated by a comparison of how the participants draft their reply when our tool warns them that their conversation is at risk of derailing into uncivil behavior versus in a control condition where the tool is disabled. These preliminary findings highlight the potential of this user-centered paradigm and point to concrete directions for future implementations.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Limited Feedback on Measurements: Sharing a Codebook or a Generative Model?\nAbstract: Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook-based solutions are well-established for limited feedback schemes in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. In recent years, data-aided solutions have been shown to achieve higher performance, enabled by the adaptivity of the feedback scheme to the propagation environment of the base station (BS) cell. In particular, a versatile limited feedback scheme utilizing Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) was recently introduced. The scheme supports multi-user communications, exhibits low complexity, supports parallelization, and offers significant flexibility concerning various system parameters. Conceptually, a GMM captures environment knowledge and is subsequently transferred to the mobile terminals (MTs) for online inference of feedback information. Afterward, the BS designs precoders using either directional information or a generative modeling-based approach. A major shortcoming of recent works is that the assessed system performance is only evaluated through synthetic simulation data that is generally unable to fully characterize the features of real-world environments. It raises the question of how the GMM-based feedback scheme performs on real-world measurement data, especially compared to the well-established DFT-based solution. Our experiments reveal that the GMM-based feedback scheme tremendously improves the system performance measured in terms of sum-rate, allowing to deploy systems with fewer pilots or feedback bits.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: A BDI Agent-Based Task Scheduling Framework for Cloud Computing\nAbstract: Cloud computing is an attractive technology for providing computing resources over the Internet. Task scheduling is a critical issue in cloud computing, where an efficient task scheduling method can improve overall cloud performance. Since cloud computing is a large-scale and geographically distributed environment, traditional scheduling methods that allocate resources in a centralized manner are ineffective. Besides, traditional methods are difficult to make rational decisions timely when the external environment changes. This paper proposes a decentralized BDI (belief-desire-intention) agent-based scheduling framework for cloud computing. BDI agents have advantages in modelling dynamic environments because BDI agents can update their beliefs, change desires, and trigger behaviours based on environmental changes. Besides, to avoid communication stuck caused by environmental uncertainties, the asynchronous communication mode with a notify listener is employed. The proposed framework covers both the task scheduling and rescheduling stages with the consideration of uncertain events that can interrupt task executions. Two agent-based algorithms are proposed to implement the task scheduling and rescheduling processes, and a novel recommendation mechanism is presented in the scheduling stage to reduce the impact of information synchronization delays. The proposed framework is implemented by JADEX and tested on CloudSim. The experimental results show that our framework can minimize the task makespan, balance the resource utilization in a large-scale environment, and maximize the task success rate when uncertain events occur.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

Therefore, we proposed a novel control law to compute the acceleration commands of each vehicle that includes the integral of the spacing error, which endows the controller with the capability to mitigate external disturbances in steady-state conditions. We adopt a constant distance spacing policy and employ generalized look-ahead and bidirectional network topologies. We provide formal conditions for the controller synthesis that ensure the internal stability of the platoon under the proposed control law in the presence of constant and bounded disturbances affecting multiple vehicles.

Specifically, the model learns deep latent embeddings from different item auxiliary information using variational auto-encoders (VAE), which could form a generative distribution over each auxiliary information by introducing a latent variable parameterized by deep neural network. Moreover, to recommend tags for new items, item multi-auxiliary latent embeddings are utilized as a surrogate through the item decoder for predicting recommendation probabilities of each tag, where reconstruction losses are added in the training phase to constrict the generation for feedback predictions via different auxiliary embeddings. In addition, an inductive variational graph auto-encoder is designed where new item nodes could be inferred in the test phase, such that item social embeddings could be exploited for new items.

We first derive two different lower bounds to the compression ratio that depend on the number of states of the lossless encoder. Both bounds are asymptotically achievable by conceptually simple coding schemes. We then show that when the number of states of the lossless encoder is large enough in terms of the reconstruction block-length, the performance can be improved, sometimes significantly so. In particular, the improved performance is achievable using a random-coding ensemble that is universal, not only in terms of the source sequence, but also in terms of the distortion measure.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Error Inhibiting Block One-Step Schemes for Ordinary Differential Equations\nAbstract: The commonly used one step methods and linear multi-step methods all have a global error that is of the same order as the local truncation error (as defined in \\cite{gustafsson1995time,quarteroni2010numerical,AllenIsaacson,IsaacsonKeller,Sewell}). In fact, this is true of the entire class of general linear methods. In practice, this means that the order of the method is typically defined solely by the order conditions which are derived by studying the local truncation error. In this work, we investigate the interplay between the local truncation error and the global error, and develop a methodology which defines the construction of explicit {\\em error inhibiting} block one-step methods (alternatively written as explicit general linear methods \\cite{butcher1993a}). These {\\em error inhibiting schemes} are constructed so that the accumulation of the local truncation error over time is controlled, which results in a global error that is one order higher than the local truncation error. In this work, we delineate how to carefully choose the coefficient matrices so that the growth of the local truncation error is inhibited. We then use this theoretical understanding to construct several methods that have higher order global error than local truncation error, and demonstrate their enhanced order of accuracy on test cases.

{"text": "Title: The Natural Selection of Conservative Science\nAbstract: Social epistemologists have argued that high risk, high reward science has an important role to play in scientific communities. Recently, though, it has also been argued that various scientific fields seem to be trending towards conservatism -- the increasing production of what Kuhn (1970) would have called `normal science'. This paper will explore a possible explanation for this sort of trend: that the process by which scientific research groups form, grow, and dissolve might be inherently hostile to high risk science. In particular, I employ a paradigm developed by Smaldino and McElreath (2016) that treats a scientific community as a population undergoing selection. As will become clear, perhaps counter-intuitively this sort of process in some ways promotes high risk, high reward science. But, as I will point out, high risk high reward science is, in general, the sort of thing that is hard to repeat. While more conservative scientists will be able to train students capable of continuing their successful projects, and so create thriving lineages, successful risky science may not be the sort of thing one can easily pass on. In such cases, the structure of scientific communities selects against high risk, high rewards projects. More generally, this paper makes clear that there are at least two processes to consider in thinking about how incentives shape scientific communities -- the process by which individual scientists make choices about their careers and research, and the selective process governing the formation of new research groups.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

By reason of the fully coupling structure between the forward and backward equations, it leads to a highly interdependence in solutions. We are able to lower the coupling of FBSDEs, by virtue of the idea of transformation, without losing the well-posedness.

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a model based algorithm to optimize preference learning, which first fitting a reward model for preference score, and then optimizing generating policy with on-policy PPO algorithm to maximize the reward. The processing of RLHF is complex, time-consuming and unstable. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm using off-policy algorithm to direct optimize generating policy and eliminating the need for reward model, which is data efficient and stable. DPO use Bradley-Terry model and log-loss which leads to over-fitting to the preference data at the expense of ignoring KL-regularization term when preference near deterministic. IPO uses a root-finding pairwise MSE loss to solve the ignoring KL-regularization problem, and learning an optimal policy. But IPO's pairwise loss still can't s make the KL-regularization to work. In this paper, we design a simple and intuitive off-policy preferences optimization algorithm from an importance sampling view, and add an off-policy KL-regularization term which makes KL-regularization truly effective. To simplify the learning process and save memory usage, we can generate regularization data in advance, which eliminate the needs for both reward model and reference policy in the stage of optimization.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: On Choosing Committees Based on Approval Votes in the Presence of Outliers\nAbstract: We study the computational complexity of committee selection problem for several approval-based voting rules in the presence of outliers. Our first result shows that outlier consideration makes committee selection problem intractable for approval, net approval, and minisum approval voting rules. We then study parameterized complexity of this problem with five natural parameters, namely the target score, the size of the committee (and its dual parameter, the number of candidates outside the committee), the number of outliers (and its dual parameter, the number of non-outliers). For net approval and minisum approval voting rules, we provide a dichotomous result, resolving the parameterized complexity of this problem for all subsets of five natural parameters considered (by showing either FPT or W[1]-hardness for all subsets of parameters). For the approval voting rule, we resolve the parameterized complexity of this problem for all subsets of parameters except one. We also study approximation algorithms for this problem. We show that there does not exist any alpha(.) factor approximation algorithm for approval and net approval voting rules, for any computable function alpha(.), unless P=NP.

The response of the medium is governed by a system of two coupled semilinear partial differential equations for the electric fields at frequency $\\omega$ and $2\\omega$.

{"text": "Title: On the hierarchical Bayesian modelling of frequency response functions\nAbstract: For situations that may benefit from information sharing among datasets, e.g., population-based SHM of similar structures, the hierarchical Bayesian approach provides a useful modelling structure. Hierarchical Bayesian models learn statistical distributions at the population (or parent) and the domain levels simultaneously, to bolster statistical strength among the parameters. As a result, variance is reduced among the parameter estimates, particularly when data are limited. In this paper, a combined probabilistic FRF model is developed for a small population of nominally-identical helicopter blades, using a hierarchical Bayesian structure, to support information transfer in the context of sparse data. The modelling approach is also demonstrated in a traditional SHM context, for a single helicopter blade exposed to varying temperatures, to show how the inclusion of physics-based knowledge can improve generalisation beyond the training data, in the context of scarce data. These models address critical challenges in SHM, by accommodating benign variations that present as differences in the underlying dynamics, while also considering (and utilising), the similarities among the domains.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: On the Ideal Number of Groups for Isometric Gradient Propagation\nAbstract: Recently, various normalization layers have been proposed to stabilize the training of deep neural networks. Among them, group normalization is a generalization of layer normalization and instance normalization by allowing a degree of freedom in the number of groups it uses. However, to determine the optimal number of groups, trial-and-error-based hyperparameter tuning is required, and such experiments are time-consuming. In this study, we discuss a reasonable method for setting the number of groups. First, we find that the number of groups influences the gradient behavior of the group normalization layer. Based on this observation, we derive the ideal number of groups, which calibrates the gradient scale to facilitate gradient descent optimization. Our proposed number of groups is theoretically grounded, architecture-aware, and can provide a proper value in a layer-wise manner for all layers.

Two different reduced order models are presented, which differ on the stabilization used during the Galerkin projection. In the first case the VMS stabilization method is used at both the full order and the reduced order level. In the second case, the VMS stabilization is used only at the full order level, while the projection of the standard Navier-Stokes equations is performed instead at the reduced order level. The former method is denoted as consistent ROM, while the latter is named non-consistent ROM, in order to underline the different choices made at the two levels. Particular attention is also devoted to the role of inf-sup stabilization by means of supremizers in ROMs based on a VMS formulation.

{"text": "Title: How Do Pedestrians' Perception Change toward Autonomous Vehicles during Unmarked Midblock Multilane Crossings: Role of AV Operation and Signal Indication\nAbstract: One of the primary impediments hindering the widespread acceptance of autonomous vehicles (AVs) among pedestrians is their limited comprehension of AVs. This study employs virtual reality (VR) to provide pedestrians with an immersive environment for engaging with and comprehending AVs during unmarked midblock multilane crossings. Diverse AV driving behaviors were modeled to exhibit negotiation behavior with a yellow signal indication or non-yielding behavior with a blue signal indication. This paper aims to investigate the impact of various factors, such as AV behavior and signaling, pedestrian past behavior, etc., on pedestrians' perception change of AVs. Before and after the VR experiment, participants completed surveys assessing their perception of AVs, focusing on two main aspects: \"Attitude\" and \"System Effectiveness.\" The Wilcoxon signed-rank test results demonstrated that both pedestrians' overall attitude score toward AVs and trust in the effectiveness of AV systems significantly increased following the VR experiment. Notably, individuals who exhibited a greater trust in the yellow signals were more inclined to display a higher attitude score toward AVs and to augment their trust in the effectiveness of AV systems. This indicates that the design of the yellow signal instills pedestrians with greater confidence in their interactions with AVs. Further, pedestrians who exhibit more aggressive crossing behavior are less likely to change their perception towards AVs as compared to those pedestrians with more positive crossing behaviors. It is concluded that integrating this paper's devised AV behavior and signaling within an immersive VR setting facilitated pedestrian engagement with AVs, thereby changing their perception of AVs.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Same Influenza, Different Responses: Social Media Can Sense a Regional Spectrum of Symptoms\nAbstract: Influenza is an acute respiratory infection caused by a virus. It is highly contagious and rapidly mutative. However, its epidemiological characteristics are conventionally collected in terms of outpatient records. In fact, the subjective bias of the doctor emphasizes exterior signs, and the necessity of face-to-face inquiry results in an inaccurate and time-consuming manner of data collection and aggregation. Accordingly, the inferred spectrum of syndromes can be incomplete and lagged. With a massive number of users being sensors, online social media can indeed provide an alternative approach. Voluntary reports in Twitter and its variants can deliver not only exterior signs but also interior feelings such as emotions. These sophisticated signals can further be efficiently collected and aggregated in a real-time manner, and a comprehensive spectrum of syndromes could thus be inferred. Taking Weibo as an example, it is confirmed that a regional spectrum of symptoms can be credibly sensed. Aside from the differences in symptoms and treatment incentives between northern and southern China, it is also surprising that patients in the south are more optimistic, while those in the north demonstrate more intense emotions. The differences sensed from Weibo can even help improve the performance of regressions in monitoring influenza.

Many studies explored Shapley value based methods to evaluate each party's contribution to the learned model.

{"text": "Title: Secure Multiparty Computation with Partial Fairness\nAbstract: A protocol for computing a functionality is secure if an adversary in this protocol cannot cause more harm than in an ideal computation where parties give their inputs to a trusted party which returns the output of the functionality to all parties. In particular, in the ideal model such computation is fair -- all parties get the output. Cleve (STOC 1986) proved that, in general, fairness is not possible without an honest majority. To overcome this impossibility, Gordon and Katz (Eurocrypt 2010) suggested a relaxed definition -- 1/p-secure computation -- which guarantees partial fairness. For two parties, they construct 1/p-secure protocols for functionalities for which the size of either their domain or their range is polynomial (in the security parameter). Gordon and Katz ask whether their results can be extended to multiparty protocols. We study 1/p-secure protocols in the multiparty setting for general functionalities. Our main result is constructions of 1/p-secure protocols when the number of parties is constant provided that less than 2/3 of the parties are corrupt. Our protocols require that either (1) the functionality is deterministic and the size of the domain is polynomial (in the security parameter), or (2) the functionality can be randomized and the size of the range is polynomial. If the size of the domain is constant and the functionality is deterministic, then our protocol is efficient even when the number of parties is O(log log n) (where n is the security parameter). On the negative side, we show that when the number of parties is super-constant, 1/p-secure protocols are not possible when the size of the domain is polynomial.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

In this paper, we finish our analysis in the context of Wasserstein gradient flows with underlying energy functional satisfying McCann's condition. More prescisely, we establish that the value function for a linearly controlled gradient flow problem whose running cost is quadratic in the control variable and just continuous in the state variable yields a viscosity solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation in terms of two operators introduced in our former works, acting as rigorous upper and lower bounds for the formal Hamiltonian at hand. The definition of these operators is directly inspired by the Evolutional Variational Inequality formulation of gradient flows (EVI): one of the main innovations of this work is to introduce a controlled version of EVI, which turns out to be crucial in establishing regularity properties, energy and metric bounds along optimzing sequences in the controlled gradient flow problem that defines the candidate solution.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

However, most relevant dynamics do not allow for computational tractability. To circumvent this difficulty, the Poisson Hypothesis regime replaces interaction times between neurons by Poisson processes. We prove that the Poisson Hypothesis holds at the limit of an infinite number of replicas in the replica-mean-field model, which consists of randomly interacting copies of the network of interest.

In Part I, we revisit the information geometry approach (IGA) for massive MIMO-OFDM channel estimation. By using the constant magnitude property of the entries of the measurement matrix in the massive MIMO-OFDM channel estimation and the asymptotic analysis, we find that the second-order natural parameters of the distributions on all the auxiliary manifolds are equivalent to each other at each iteration of IGA, and the first-order natural parameters of the distributions on all the auxiliary manifolds are asymptotically equivalent to each other at the fixed point of IGA. Motivated by these results, we simplify the iterative process of IGA and propose a simplified IGA for massive MIMO-OFDM channel estimation. It is proved that at the fixed point, the a posteriori mean obtained by the simplified IGA is asymptotically optimal. The simplified IGA allows efficient implementation with fast Fourier transformation (FFT). Simulations confirm that the simplified IGA can achieve near the optimal performance with low complexity in a limited number of iterations.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

This study explores the phototactic bioconvection in a suspension of anisotropic scattering phototactic algae, illuminated by diffuse flux without direct collimated flux. The basic state is characterized by zero fluid flow, with the balance between upward and downward swimming due to positive and negative phototaxis, respectively, counteracted by microorganism diffusion.

If the vector field of a TPDS is T-periodic then every bounded trajectory converges to a T-periodic solution. In particular, when the vector field is time-invariant every bounded trajectory of a TPDS converges to an equlbrium. Here, we use the spectral theory of oscillatory matrices to analyze the behavior near a periodic solution of a TPDS.

{"text": "Title: Spikformer V2: Join the High Accuracy Club on ImageNet with an SNN Ticket\nAbstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), known for their biologically plausible architecture, face the challenge of limited performance. The self-attention mechanism, which is the cornerstone of the high-performance Transformer and also a biologically inspired structure, is absent in existing SNNs. To this end, we explore the potential of leveraging both self-attention capability and biological properties of SNNs, and propose a novel Spiking Self-Attention (SSA) and Spiking Transformer (Spikformer). The SSA mechanism eliminates the need for softmax and captures the sparse visual feature employing spike-based Query, Key, and Value. This sparse computation without multiplication makes SSA efficient and energy-saving. Further, we develop a Spiking Convolutional Stem (SCS) with supplementary convolutional layers to enhance the architecture of Spikformer. The Spikformer enhanced with the SCS is referred to as Spikformer V2. To train larger and deeper Spikformer V2, we introduce a pioneering exploration of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) within the SNN. Specifically, we pre-train Spikformer V2 with masking and reconstruction style inspired by the mainstream self-supervised Transformer, and then finetune the Spikformer V2 on the image classification on ImageNet. Extensive experiments show that Spikformer V2 outperforms other previous surrogate training and ANN2SNN methods. An 8-layer Spikformer V2 achieves an accuracy of 80.38% using 4 time steps, and after SSL, a 172M 16-layer Spikformer V2 reaches an accuracy of 81.10% with just 1 time step.

{"text": "Title: The model theory of the curve graph\nAbstract: In this paper we develop a bridge between model theory, geometric topology, and geometric group theory. In particular, we investigate the Ivanov Metaconjecture from the point of view of model theory, and more broadly we seek to answer the general question: why does the curve graph of a surface play such a central role in the study of surfaces and mapping class groups? More specifically, we consider a surface $\\Sigma$ of finite type and its curve graph $\\mathcal C(\\Sigma)$, and we investigate its first-order theory in the language of graph theory. Crucially, $\\mathcal C(\\Sigma)$ is bi-interpretable with a certain object called the augmented Cayley graph of the mapping class group of the surface. We use this bi-interpretation to prove that the theory of the curve graph is $\\omega$--stable, to compute its Morley rank, and to show that it has quantifier elimination with respect to the class of $\\forall\\exists$--formulae. We also show that many of the complexes which are naturally associated to a surface are interpretable in $\\mathcal C(\\Sigma)$. This shows that these complexes are all $\\omega$--stable and admit certain a priori bounds on their Morley ranks. We are able to use Morley ranks to prove that various complexes are not bi--interpretable with the curve graph. As a consequence of quantifier elimination, we show that algebraic intersection number is not definable in the first order theory of the curve graph. Finally, we prove that the curve graph of a surface enjoys a novel phenomenon that we call interpretation rigidity. That is, if surfaces $\\Sigma_1$ and $\\Sigma_2$ admits curve graphs that are mutually interpretable, then $\\Sigma_1$ and $\\Sigma_2$ are homeomorphic to each other.

The presence of multiple antennas at the BS introduces spatial degrees-of-freedom, enabling concurrent transmission of status updates from multiple devices in each time slot. Our objective is to optimize network-wide information freshness, quantified by the age of information (AoI) metric, by determining how the BS can best schedule device transmissions, while taking into account the random arrival of status updates at the device side.To address this decision-making problem, we model it as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and establish that the evolution of belief states for different devices is independent.We also prove that feasible belief states can be described by finite-dimensional vectors. Building on these observations, we develop a dynamic scheduling (DS) policy to solve the POMDP, and then derive an upper bound of its AoI performance, which is used to optimize the parameter configuration. To gain more design insights, we investigate a symmetric network, and put forth a fixed scheduling (FS) policy with lower computational complexity. An action space reduction strategy is applied to further reduce the computational complexity of both DS and FS policies. Our numerical results validate our analyses and indicate that the DS policy with the reduced action space performs almost identically to the original DS policy, and both outperform the baseline policies.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

Early diagnosis and treatment are vital for enhancing the patients' survival rate. Downsampling in deep networks may lead to loss of information, so for compensating the detail and edge information and allowing convolutional neural networks to pay more attention to seek the lesion region, we propose a multi-stages attention architecture based on NSNP neurons with autapses. First, unlike the single-scale attention acquisition methods of existing methods, we set up spatial attention acquisition at each feature map scale of the convolutional network to obtain an fusion global information on attention guidance. Then we introduce a new type of NSNP variants called NSNP neurons with autapses. Specifically, NSNP systems are modularized as feature encoders, recoding the features extracted from convolutional neural network as well as the fusion of attention information and preserve the key characteristic elements in feature maps. This ensures the retention of valuable data while gradually transforming high-dimensional complicated info into low-dimensional ones. The proposed method is evaluated on the public dataset BreakHis at various magnifications and classification tasks.

Additionally, the CI model needs only one very subtle and simple modification to the existing 3GPP floating-intercept path loss model (replacing a constant with a close-in free space reference value) in order to provide greater simulation accuracy, more simplicity, better repeatability across experiments, and higher stability across a vast range of frequencies.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

Certain decision problems for $k$-CNs become easier, or indeed decidable, when the dimension $k$ is small. Yet, little is known about the effect that the dimension $k$ has on the class of languages recognised by $k$-CNs. Specifically, it would be useful if we could simplify algorithmic reasoning by reducing the dimension of a given CN. To this end, we introduce the notion of dimension-primality for $k$-CN, whereby a $k$-CN is prime if it recognises a language that cannot be decomposed into a finite intersection of languages recognised by $d$-CNs, for some $d<k$. We show that primality is undecidable. We also study two related notions: dimension-minimality (where we seek a single language-equivalent $d$-CN of lower dimension) and language regularity.

In this paper, we study fairness issues that arise when decision-makers use models (proxy models) that deviate from the models that depict the physical and social environment in which the decisions are situated (intended models). We also highlight the effect of obstacles on individual access and utilization of the models. To this end, we formulate an Equity Framework that considers equal access to the model, equal outcomes from the model, and equal utilization of the model, and consequentially achieves equity and higher social welfare than current fairness notions that aim for equality. We show how the three main aspects of the framework are connected and provide an equity scoring algorithm and questions to guide decision-makers towards equitable decision-making. We show how failure to consider access, outcome, and utilization would exacerbate proxy gaps leading to an infinite inequity loop that reinforces structural inequities through inaccurate and incomplete ground truth curation.

Our proposed group adaptive classifier mitigates bias by using adaptive convolution kernels and attention mechanisms on faces based on their demographic attributes. The adaptive module comprises kernel masks and channel-wise attention maps for each demographic group so as to activate different facial regions for identification, leading to more discriminative features pertinent to their demographics. Our introduced automated adaptation strategy determines whether to apply adaptation to a certain layer by iteratively computing the dissimilarity among demographic-adaptive parameters.

{"text": "Title: Shift Graphs, Chromatic Number and Acyclic One-Path Orientations\nAbstract: Shift graphs, which were introduced by Erd\\H{o}s and Hajnal, have been used to answer various questions in extremal graph theory. In this paper, we prove two new results using shift graphs and their induced subgraphs. 1. Recently Girao [Combinatorica2023], showed that for every graph $F$ with at least one edge, there is a constant $c_F$ such that there are graphs of arbitrarily large chromatic number and the same clique number as $F$, in which every $F$-free induced subgraph has chromatic number at most $c_F$. We significantly improve the value of the constant $c_F$ for the special case where $F$ is the complete bipartite graph $K_{a,b}$. We show that any $K_{a,b}$-free induced subgraph of the triangle-free shift graph $G_{n,2}$ has chromatic number at most $a+b$. 2. An undirected simple graph $G$ is said to have the AOP Property if it can be acyclically oriented such that there is at most one directed path between any two vertices. We prove that the shift graph $G_{n,2}$ does not have the AOP property for all $n\\geq 9$. We then construct induced subgraphs of shift graph $G_{n,2}$ with an arbitrarily high chromatic number and odd-girth which have the AOP property. To the best of our knowledge, this gives the first constructive proof of the existence of graphs with arbitrarily high chromatic number and odd-girth that have the AOP property. Furthermore, we construct graphs with arbitrarily high odd-girth that do not have the AOP Property and also prove the existence of graphs with girth equal to $5$ that do not have the AOP property.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Evasive Hardware Trojan through Adversarial Power Trace\nAbstract: The globalization of the Integrated Circuit (IC) supply chain, driven by time-to-market and cost considerations, has made ICs vulnerable to hardware Trojans (HTs). Against this threat, a promising approach is to use Machine Learning (ML)-based side-channel analysis, which has the advantage of being a non-intrusive method, along with efficiently detecting HTs under golden chip-free settings. In this paper, we question the trustworthiness of ML-based HT detection via side-channel analysis. We introduce a HT obfuscation (HTO) approach to allow HTs to bypass this detection method. Rather than theoretically misleading the model by simulated adversarial traces, a key aspect of our approach is the design and implementation of adversarial noise as part of the circuitry, alongside the HT. We detail HTO methodologies for ASICs and FPGAs, and evaluate our approach using TrustHub benchmark. Interestingly, we found that HTO can be implemented with only a single transistor for ASIC designs to generate adversarial power traces that can fool the defense with 100% efficiency. We also efficiently implemented our approach on a Spartan 6 Xilinx FPGA using 2 different variants: (i) DSP slices-based, and (ii) ring-oscillator-based design. Additionally, we assess the efficiency of countermeasures like spectral domain analysis, and we show that an adaptive attacker can still design evasive HTOs by constraining the design with a spectral noise budget. In addition, while adversarial training (AT) offers higher protection against evasive HTs, AT models suffer from a considerable utility loss, potentially rendering them unsuitable for such security application.

Wikipedia is a visible and successful example of such a collaboration which might offer insight into what makes large-scale, decentralized collaborations successful. We analyze the relationship between the structural properties of WikiProject coeditor networks and the performance and efficiency of those projects. We confirm the existence of an overall performance-efficiency trade-off, while observing that some projects are higher than others in both performance and efficiency, suggesting the existence factors correlating positively with both. Namely, we find an association between low-degree coeditor networks and both high performance and high efficiency. We also confirm results seen in previous numerical and small-scale lab studies: higher performance with less skewed node distributions, and higher performance with shorter path lengths. We use agent-based models to explore possible mechanisms for degree-dependent performance and efficiency. We present a novel local-majority learning strategy designed to satisfy properties of real-world collaborations. The local-majority strategy as well as a localized conformity-based strategy both show degree-dependent performance and efficiency, but in opposite directions, suggesting that these factors depend on both network structure and learning strategy. Our results suggest possible benefits to decentralized collaborations made of smaller, more tightly-knit teams, and that these benefits may be modulated by the particular learning strategies in use.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

High-resolution satellites such as TerraSAR-X provide images that can be combined to produce 3-D models. In urban areas, sparsity priors are generally enforced during the tomographic inversion process in order to retrieve the location of scatterers seen within a given radar resolution cell. However, such priors often miss parts of the urban surfaces. Those missing parts are typically regions of flat areas such as ground or rooftops. This paper introduces a surface segmentation algorithm based on the computation of the optimal cut in a flow network. This segmentation process can be included within the 3-D reconstruction framework in order to improve the recovery of urban surfaces.

However, such relations, represented as edges in the underlying graphical model, expose an extra attack surface to the adversaries. We study adversarial robustness of an important class of such graphical models, Associative Markov Networks (AMN), to structural attacks, where an attacker can modify the graph structure at test time. We formulate the task of learning a robust AMN classifier as a bi-level program, where the inner problem is a challenging non-linear integer program that computes optimal structural changes to the AMN. To address this technical challenge, we first relax the attacker problem, and then use duality to obtain a convex quadratic upper bound for the robust AMN problem. We then prove a bound on the quality of the resulting approximately optimal solutions, and experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Finally, we apply our approach in a transductive learning setting, and show that robust AMN is much more robust than state-of-the-art deep learning methods, while sacrificing little in accuracy on non-adversarial data.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

Under a finite-allele mutation model, with possibly parent-dependent mutation, we consider the asymptotic regime where the selective advantage of one allele grows to infinity, while the other parameters remain fixed. In this regime, we show that the Wright-Fisher diffusion can be approximated either by a Gaussian process or by a process whose components are independent continuous-state branching processes with immigration, aligning with analogous results for Wright-Fisher models but employing different methods. While the first process becomes degenerate at stationarity, the latter does not and provides a simple, analytic approximation for the leading term of the sampling probability. Furthermore, using another approach based on a recursion formula, we characterise all remaining terms to provide a full asymptotic expansion for the sampling probability. Finally, we study the asymptotic behaviour of the rates of the block-counting process of the conditional ancestral selection graph and establish an asymptotic duality relationship between this and the diffusion.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

This well-known problem has led to the development of post-hoc calibration procedures, such as Platt scaling (logistic), isotonic and beta calibration, which transforms the scores into well calibrated empirical probabilities. A plausible alternative to the calibration approach is to use Bayesian neural networks, which directly models a predictive distribution.

A cognitive synergist is an intelligent agent that collaboratively combines multiple minds' strengths and knowledge to enhance problem-solving in complex tasks. By dynamically identifying and simulating different personas based on task inputs, SPP unleashes the potential of cognitive synergy in LLMs. Our in-depth analysis shows that assigning multiple fine-grained personas in LLMs improves problem-solving abilities compared to using a single or fixed number of personas.

{"text": "Title: Challenges and Opportunities in High-dimensional Variational Inference\nAbstract: Current black-box variational inference (BBVI) methods require the user to make numerous design choices -- such as the selection of variational objective and approximating family -- yet there is little principled guidance on how to do so. We develop a conceptual framework and set of experimental tools to understand the effects of these choices, which we leverage to propose best practices for maximizing posterior approximation accuracy. Our approach is based on studying the pre-asymptotic tail behavior of the density ratios between the joint distribution and the variational approximation, then exploiting insights and tools from the importance sampling literature. Our framework and supporting experiments help to distinguish between the behavior of BBVI methods for approximating low-dimensional versus moderate-to-high-dimensional posteriors. In the latter case, we show that mass-covering variational objectives are difficult to optimize and do not improve accuracy, but flexible variational families can improve accuracy and the effectiveness of importance sampling -- at the cost of additional optimization challenges. Therefore, for moderate-to-high-dimensional posteriors we recommend using the (mode-seeking) exclusive KL divergence since it is the easiest to optimize, and improving the variational family or using model parameter transformations to make the posterior and optimal variational approximation more similar. On the other hand, in low-dimensional settings, we show that heavy-tailed variational families and mass-covering divergences are effective and can increase the chances that the approximation can be improved by importance sampling.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

The system is integrated with the ABM method for fractional-order equations.

The bifurcation diagrams versus the fractional order, and versus one parameter, reveal a strange phenomenon suggesting that the bifurcation branches generated by initial conditions outside neighborhoods of unstable equilibria are spurious sets although they look similar with those generated by initial conditions close to the equilibria. These spurious sets look ``delayed'' in the considered bifurcation scenario. Once the integration step-size is reduced, the spurious branches maintain their shapes but tend to the branches obtained from initial condition within neighborhoods of equilibria. While the spurious branches move once the integration step size reduces, the branches generated by the initial conditions near the equilibria maintain their positions in the considered bifurcation space.

Even for data from a randomized controlled trial, the hazard ratio suffers from built-in selection bias as, over time, the individuals at risk in the exposed and unexposed are no longer exchangeable. In this work, we formalize how the observed hazard ratio evolves and deviates from the causal hazard ratio of interest in the presence of heterogeneity of the hazard of unexposed individuals (frailty) and heterogeneity in effect (individual modification). For the case of effect heterogeneity, we define the causal hazard ratio. We show that the observed hazard ratio equals the ratio of expectations of the latent variables (frailty and modifier) conditionally on survival in the world with and without exposure, respectively. Examples with gamma, inverse Gaussian and compound Poisson distributed frailty, and categorical (harming, beneficial or neutral) effect modifiers are presented for illustration. This set of examples shows that an observed hazard ratio with a particular value can arise for all values of the causal hazard ratio. Therefore, the hazard ratio can not be used as a measure of the causal effect without making untestable assumptions, stressing the importance of using more appropriate estimands such as contrasts of the survival probabilities.", "field": "math", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Trajectory Optimization for Completion Time Minimization in UAV-Enabled Multicasting\nAbstract: This paper studies an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled multicasting system, where a UAV is dispatched to disseminate a common file to a number of geographically distributed ground terminals (GTs). Our objective is to design the UAV trajectory to minimize its mission completion time, while ensuring that each GT is able to successfully recover the file with a high probability required. We consider the use of practical random linear network coding (RLNC) for UAV multicasting, so that each GT is able to recover the file as long as it receives a sufficiently large number of coded packets. However, the formulated UAV trajectory optimization problem is non-convex and difficult to be directly solved. To tackle this issue, we first derive an analytical lower bound for the success probability of each GT's file recovery. Based on this result, we then reformulate the problem into a more tractable form, where the UAV trajectory only needs to be designed to meet a set of constraints each on the minimum connection time with a GT, during which their distance is below a designed threshold. We show that the optimal UAV trajectory only needs to constitute connected line segments, thus it can be obtained by determining first the optimal set of waypoints and then UAV speed along the lines connecting the waypoints. We propose practical schemes for the waypoints design based on a novel concept of virtual base station (VBS) placement and by applying convex optimization techniques. Furthermore, for given set of waypoints, we obtain the optimal UAV speed over the resulting path efficiently by solving a linear programming (LP) problem. Numerical results show that the proposed UAV-enabled multicasting with optimized trajectory design achieves significant performance gains as compared to benchmark schemes.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

We first give a simple proof of the known weighted analytic regularity in a polygon, relying on a new formulation of elliptic a priori estimates in smooth domains with analytic control of derivatives. The technique is based on dyadic partitions near the corners. This technique can successfully be extended to polyhedra, providing isotropic analytic regularity.

Much AI/ML research has focused on expanding the range of tasks that machines can do, with a focus on whether machines can beat humans. Allowing for differences in scale, we can seek interesting (anomalous) pairs of tasks T, T'. We define interesting in this way: The \"harder to learn\" relation is reversed when comparing human intelligence (HI) to AI. While humans seems to be able to understand problems by formulating rules, ML using neural networks does not rely on constructing rules. We discuss a novel approach where the challenge is to \"perform well under rules that have been created by human beings.\" We suggest that this provides a rigorous and precise pathway for understanding the difference between the two kinds of learning. Specifically, we suggest a large and extensible class of learning tasks, formulated as learning under rules. With these tasks, both the AI and HI will be studied with rigor and precision. The immediate goal is to find interesting groundtruth rule pairs. In the long term, the goal will be to understand, in a generalizable way, what distinguishes interesting pairs from ordinary pairs, and to define saliency behind interesting pairs.

{"text": "Title: Gesture-to-Gesture Translation in the Wild via Category-Independent Conditional Maps\nAbstract: Recent works have shown Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to be particularly effective in image-to-image translations. However, in tasks such as body pose and hand gesture translation, existing methods usually require precise annotations, e.g. key-points or skeletons, which are time-consuming to draw. In this work, we propose a novel GAN architecture that decouples the required annotations into a category label - that specifies the gesture type - and a simple-to-draw category-independent conditional map - that expresses the location, rotation and size of the hand gesture. Our architecture synthesizes the target gesture while preserving the background context, thus effectively dealing with gesture translation in the wild. To this aim, we use an attention module and a rolling guidance approach, which loops the generated images back into the network and produces higher quality images compared to competing works. Thus, our GAN learns to generate new images from simple annotations without requiring key-points or skeleton labels. Results on two public datasets show that our method outperforms state of the art approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.

{"text": "Title: Physics-Inspired Discrete-Phase Optimization for 3D Beamforming with PIN-Diode Extra-Large Antenna Arrays\nAbstract: Large antenna arrays can steer narrow beams towards a target area, and thus improve the communications capacity of wireless channels and the fidelity of radio sensing. Hardware that is capable of continuously-variable phase shifts is expensive, presenting scaling challenges. PIN diodes that apply only discrete phase shifts are promising and cost-effective; however, unlike continuous phase shifters, finding the best phase configuration across elements is an NP-hard optimization problem. Thus, the complexity of optimization becomes a new bottleneck for large-antenna arrays. To address this challenge, this paper suggests a procedure for converting the optimization objective function from a ratio of quadratic functions to a sequence of more easily solvable quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) sub-problems. This conversion is an exact equivalence, and the resulting QUBO forms are standard input formats for various physics-inspired optimization methods. We demonstrate that a simulated annealing approach is very effective for solving these sub-problems, and we give performance metrics for several large array types optimized by this technique.

We rely on a feasible sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm capable of generating feasible intermediate iterates such that the solver can be stopped after any number of iterations, without jeopardizing recursive feasibility. In this way, we provide a strategy that computes suboptimal and yet feasible solutions with a computational footprint that is much lower than state-of-the-art methods based on the computation of locally optimal solutions. Under suitable assumptions on the terminal set and on the controllability properties of the system, we can state that, for any sufficiently small disturbance affecting the system's dynamics, recursive feasibility can be guaranteed. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in simulation and by deploying it onto a physical experiment with autonomous miniature race cars. Both the simulation and experimental results demonstrate that, using the feasible SQP method, a feasible solution can be obtained with moderate additional computational effort compared to strategies that resort to early termination without providing a feasible solution.

To be more precise, we consider a class of multiplicity-free Hamiltonian actions by regular proper symplectic groupoids that we call faithful. Given such a groupoid, we classify its faithful multiplicity-free Hamiltonian actions in terms of what we call Delzant subspaces of its orbit space -- certain `suborbifolds with corners' satisfying the Delzant condition relative to the integral affine orbifold structure of the orbit space. This encompasses both the classification of symplectic toric manifolds (due to Delzant) in terms of Delzant polytopes and the classification of proper Lagrangian fibrations over an integral affine base manifold (due to Duistermaat) in terms of a sheaf cohomology group. Each Delzant subspace comes with an orbifold version of this cohomology, the degree one part of which classifies faithful multiplicity-free Hamiltonian actions with momentum map image equal to the Delzant subspace, provided there exists such an action. The obstruction to existence is encoded by a degree two class in this cohomology: the Lagrangian Dixmier-Douady class.

{"text": "Title: Variational Bandwidth Auto-encoder for Hybrid Recommender Systems\nAbstract: Hybrid recommendations have recently attracted a lot of attention where user features are utilized as auxiliary information to address the sparsity problem caused by insufficient user-item interactions. However, extracted user features generally contain rich multimodal information, and most of them are irrelevant to the recommendation purpose. Therefore, excessive reliance on these features will make the model overfit on noise and difficult to generalize. In this article, we propose a variational bandwidth auto-encoder (VBAE) for recommendations, aiming to address the sparsity and noise problems simultaneously. VBAE first encodes user collaborative and feature information into Gaussian latent variables via deep neural networks to capture non-linear user similarities. Moreover, by considering the fusion of collaborative and feature variables as a virtual communication channel from an information-theoretic perspective, we introduce a user-dependent channel to dynamically control the information allowed to be accessed from the feature embeddings. A quantum-inspired uncertainty measurement of the hidden rating embeddings is proposed accordingly to infer the channel bandwidth by disentangling the uncertainty information in the ratings from the semantic information. Through this mechanism, VBAE incorporates adequate auxiliary information from user features if collaborative information is insufficient, while avoiding excessive reliance on noisy user features to improve its generalization ability to new users.

{"text": "Title: Towards a Solution to Bongard Problems: A Causal Approach\nAbstract: Even though AI has advanced rapidly in recent years displaying success in solving highly complex problems, the class of Bongard Problems (BPs) yet remain largely unsolved by modern ML techniques. In this paper, we propose a new approach in an attempt to not only solve BPs but also extract meaning out of learned representations. This includes the reformulation of the classical BP into a reinforcement learning (RL) setting which will allow the model to gain access to counterfactuals to guide its decisions but also explain its decisions. Since learning meaningful representations in BPs is an essential sub-problem, we further make use of contrastive learning for the extraction of low level features from pixel data. Several experiments have been conducted for analyzing the general BP-RL setup, feature extraction methods and using the best combination for the feature space analysis and its interpretation.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Planar Para Algebras, Reflection Positivity\nAbstract: We define a planar para algebra, which arises naturally from combining planar algebras with the idea of $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$ para symmetry in physics. A subfactor planar para algebra is a Hilbert space representation of planar tangles with parafermionic defects, that are invariant under para isotopy. For each $\\mathbb{Z}_{N}$, we construct a family of subfactor planar para algebras which play the role of Temperley-Lieb-Jones planar algebras. The first example in this family is the parafermion planar para algebra (PAPPA). Based on this example, we introduce parafermion Pauli matrices, quaternion relations, and braided relations for parafermion algebras which one can use in the study of quantum information. An important ingredient in planar para algebra theory is the string Fourier transform (SFT), that we use on the matrix algebra generated by the Pauli matrices. Two different reflections play an important role in the theory of planar para algebras. One is the adjoint operator; the other is the modular conjugation in Tomita-Takesaki theory. We use the latter one to define the double algebra and to introduce reflection positivity. We give a new and geometric proof of reflection positivity, by relating the two reflections through the string Fourier transform.", "field": "math", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Explore Human Parsing Modality for Action Recognition\nAbstract: Multimodal-based action recognition methods have achieved high success using pose and RGB modality. However, skeletons sequences lack appearance depiction and RGB images suffer irrelevant noise due to modality limitations. To address this, we introduce human parsing feature map as a novel modality, since it can selectively retain effective semantic features of the body parts, while filtering out most irrelevant noise. We propose a new dual-branch framework called Ensemble Human Parsing and Pose Network (EPP-Net), which is the first to leverage both skeletons and human parsing modalities for action recognition. The first human pose branch feeds robust skeletons in graph convolutional network to model pose features, while the second human parsing branch also leverages depictive parsing feature maps to model parsing festures via convolutional backbones. The two high-level features will be effectively combined through a late fusion strategy for better action recognition. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 benchmarks consistently verify the effectiveness of our proposed EPP-Net, which outperforms the existing action recognition methods.

A CPG graph is a graph for which there exists a collection of pairwise interiorly disjoint paths on a grid in one-to-one correspondence with its vertex set such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if the corresponding paths touch at a grid-point. If every such path has at most $k$ bends for some $k \\geq 0$, the graph is said to be $B_k$-CPG. We first show that, for any $k \\geq 0$, the class of $B_k$-CPG graphs is strictly contained in the class of $B_{k+1}$-CPG graphs even within the class of planar graphs, thus implying that there exists no $k \\geq 0$ such that every planar CPG graph is $B_k$-CPG.

The hybrid model uses FE basis functions as a spatial basis and RNNs for the approximation of the time dependencies of the FE basis' degrees of freedom. The training data sets consist of sparse, non-uniformly sampled snapshots of the discrepancy function, pre-computed from trajectory data of low- and high-fidelity dynamic FE models. To account for data sparsity and prevent overfitting, data upsampling and local weighting factors are employed, to instigate a trade-off between physically conforming model behavior and neural network regression. The proposed hybrid modeling methodology is showcased in three highly non-trivial engineering test-cases, all featuring transient FE models, namely, heat diffusion out of a heat sink, eddy-currents in a quadrupole magnet, and sound wave propagation in a cavity. The results show that the proposed hybrid model is capable of approximating model discrepancies to a high degree of accuracy and accordingly correct low-fidelity models.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

Providing too many diversified trade-off policies to the DM not only significantly increases their workload but also introduces noise in multi-criterion decision-making. With this in mind, we propose a human-in-the-loop policy optimization framework for preference-based MORL that interactively identifies policies of interest. Our method proactively learns the DM's implicit preference information without requiring any a priori knowledge, which is often unavailable in real-world black-box decision scenarios. The learned preference information is used to progressively guide policy optimization towards policies of interest. We evaluate our approach against three conventional MORL algorithms that do not consider preference information and four state-of-the-art preference-based MORL algorithms on two MORL environments for robot control and smart grid management.

We evaluate the performance of the proposed strategies in terms of the outage probability and compare the results with those of the conventional CMF strategy, the Decode and Forward (DF) strategy, and also the centralized optimal CMF.

Generating large annotated datasets for information extraction from clinical notes is often challenging and expensive due to the high level of expertise needed for high quality annotations. To enable natural language processing for small dataset sizes, we develop a novel enriched hierarchical annotation scheme and algorithm, Supervised Line Attention (SLA), and apply this algorithm to predicting categorical tumor attributes from kidney and colon cancer pathology reports from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). Whereas previous work only annotated document level labels, we in addition ask the annotators to enrich the traditional label by asking them to also highlight the relevant line or potentially lines for the final label, which leads to a 20% increase of annotation time required per document. With the enriched annotations, we develop a simple and interpretable machine learning algorithm that first predicts the relevant lines in the document and then predicts the tumor attribute. Our results show across the small dataset sizes of 32, 64, 128, and 186 labeled documents per cancer, SLA only requires half the number of labeled documents as state-of-the-art methods to achieve similar or better micro-f1 and macro-f1 scores for the vast majority of comparisons that we made.

{"text": "Title: Hybrid and Oriented Harmonic Potentials for Safe Task Execution in Unknown Environment\nAbstract: Harmonic potentials provide globally convergent potential fields that are provably free of local minima. Due to its analytical format, it is particularly suitable for generating safe and reliable robot navigation policies. However, for complex environments that consist of a large number of overlapping non-sphere obstacles, the computation of associated transformation functions can be tedious. This becomes more apparent when: (i) the workspace is initially unknown and the underlying potential fields are updated constantly as the robot explores it; (ii) the high-level mission consists of sequential navigation tasks among numerous regions, requiring the robot to switch between different potentials. Thus, this work proposes an efficient and automated scheme to construct harmonic potentials incrementally online as guided by the task automaton. A novel two-layer harmonic tree (HT) structure is introduced that facilitates the hybrid combination of oriented search algorithms for task planning and harmonic-based navigation controllers for non-holonomic robots. Both layers are adapted efficiently and jointly during online execution to reflect the actual feasibility and cost of navigation within the updated workspace. Global safety and convergence are ensured both for the high-level task plan and the low-level robot trajectory. Known issues such as oscillation or long-detours for purely potential-based methods and sharp-turns or high computation complexity for purely search-based methods are prevented. Extensive numerical simulation and hardware experiments are conducted against several strong baselines.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Morphisms of rational motivic homotopy types\nAbstract: We investigate several interrelated foundational questions pertaining to the study of motivic dga's of Dan-Cohen--Schlank [8] and Iwanari [13]. In particular, we note that morphisms of motivic dga's can reasonably be thought of as a nonabelian analog of motivic cohomology. Just as abelian motivic cohomology is a homotopy group of a spectrum coming from K-theory, the space of morphisms of motivic dga's is a certain limit of such spectra; we give an explicit formula for this limit --- a possible first step towards explicit computations or dimension bounds. We also consider commutative comonoids in Chow motives, which we call ``motivic Chow coalgebras''. We discuss the relationship between motivic Chow coalgebras and motivic dga's of smooth proper schemes. As a small first application of our results, we show that among schemes which are finite \\'etale over a number field, morphisms of associated motivic dga's are no different than morphisms of schemes.

We then compare Langevin dynamics integrators in terms of their invariant distributions and demonstrate a superconvergence property (4th order accuracy where only 2nd order would be expected) of one method in the high friction limit; this method, moreover, can be reduced to a simple modification of the Euler-Maruyama method for Brownian dynamics involving a non-Markovian (coloured noise) random process. In the Brownian dynamics case, 2nd order accuracy of the invariant density is achieved. All methods considered are efficient for molecular applications (requiring one force evaluation per timestep) and of a simple form.

{"text": "Title: Stochastic Approach for Price Optimization Problems with Decision-dependent Uncertainty\nAbstract: Price determination is a central research topic of revenue management in marketing. The important aspect in pricing is controlling the stochastic behavior of demand, and the previous studies have tackled price optimization problems with uncertainties. However, many of those studies assumed that uncertainties are independent of decision variables (i.e., prices) and did not consider situations where demand uncertainty depends on price. Although some price optimization studies have dealt with decision-dependent uncertainty, they make application-specific assumptions in order to obtain an optimal solution or an approximation solution. To handle a wider range of applications with decision-dependent uncertainty, we propose a general non-convex stochastic optimization formulation. This approach aims to maximize the expectation of a revenue function with respect to a random variable representing demand under a decision-dependent distribution. We derived an unbiased stochastic gradient estimator by using a well-tuned variance reduction parameter and used it for a projected stochastic gradient descent method to find a stationary point of our problem. We conducted synthetic experiments and simulation experiments with real data on a retail service application.

Spiker+ presents a configurable multi-layer hardware SNN, a library of highly efficient neuron architectures, and a design framework, enabling the development of complex neural network accelerators with few lines of Python code. Spiker+ is tested on two benchmark datasets, the MNIST and the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD). On the MNIST, it demonstrates competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art SNN accelerators. It outperforms them in terms of resource allocation, with a requirement of 7,612 logic cells and 18 Block RAMs (BRAMs), which makes it fit in very small FPGA, and power consumption, draining only 180mW for a complete inference on an input image. The latency is comparable to the ones observed in the state-of-the-art, with 780us/img. To the authors' knowledge, Spiker+ is the first SNN accelerator tested on the SHD. In this case, the accelerator requires 18,268 logic cells and 51 BRAM, with an overall power consumption of 430mW and a latency of 54 us for a complete inference on input data.

{"text": "Title: The infinite Arnoldi exponential integrator for linear inhomogeneous ODEs\nAbstract: Exponential integrators that use Krylov approximations of matrix functions have turned out to be efficient for the time-integration of certain ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This holds in particular for linear homogeneous ODEs, where the exponential integrator is equivalent to approximating the product of the matrix exponential and a vector. In this paper, we consider linear inhomogeneous ODEs, $y'(t)=Ay(t)+g(t)$, where the function $g(t)$ is assumed to satisfy certain regularity conditions. We derive an algorithm for this problem which is equivalent to approximating the product of the matrix exponential and a vector using Arnoldi's method. The construction is based on expressing the function $g(t)$ as a linear combination of given basis functions $[\\phi_i]_{i=0}^\\infty$ with particular properties. The properties are such that the inhomogeneous ODE can be restated as an infinite-dimensional linear homogeneous ODE. Moreover, the linear homogeneous infinite-dimensional ODE has properties that directly allow us to extend a Krylov method for finite-dimensional linear ODEs. Although the construction is based on an infinite-dimensional operator, the algorithm can be carried out with operations involving matrices and vectors of finite size. This type of construction resembles in many ways the infinite Arnoldi method for nonlinear eigenvalue problems.

{"text": "Title: Cost Minimization in Multi-cloud Systems with Runtime Microservice Re-orchestration\nAbstract: Multi-cloud systems facilitate a cost-efficient and geographically-distributed deployment of microservice-based applications by temporary leasing virtual nodes with diverse pricing models. To preserve the cost-efficiency of multi-cloud deployments, it is essential to redeploy microservices onto the available nodes according to a dynamic resource configuration, which is often performed to better accommodate workload variations. However, this approach leads to frequent service disruption since applications are continuously shutdown and redeployed in order to apply the new resource assignment. To overcome this issue, we propose a re-orchestration scheme that migrates microservice at runtime based on a rolling update scheduling logic. Specifically, we propose an integer linear optimization problem that minimizes the cost associated to multi-cloud virtual nodes and that ensures that delay-sensitive microservices are co-located on the same regional cluster. The resulting rescheduling order guarantees no service disruption by repacking microservices between the available nodes without the need to turn off the outdated microservice instance before redeploying the updated version. In addition, we propose a two-step heuristic scheme that effectively approximates the optimal solution at the expense of close-to-zero service disruption and QoS violation probability. Results show that proposed schemes achieve better performance in terms of cost mitigation, low service disruption and low QoS violation probability compared to baseline schemes replicating Kubernetes scheduler functionalities.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

This work attempts to address the uncertainty of lifting the detected 2D joints to the 3D space by introducing an intermediate state-Part-Centric Heatmap Triplets (HEMlets), which shortens the gap between the 2D observation and the 3D interpretation. The HEMlets utilize three joint-heatmaps to represent the relative depth information of the end-joints for each skeletal body part. In our approach, a Convolutional Network (ConvNet) is first trained to predict HEMlets from the input image, followed by a volumetric joint-heatmap regression. We leverage on the integral operation to extract the joint locations from the volumetric heatmaps, guaranteeing end-to-end learning. Despite the simplicity of the network design, the quantitative comparisons show a significant performance improvement over the best-of-grade methods (e.g. $20\\%$ on Human3.6M). The proposed method naturally supports training with \"in-the-wild\" images, where only weakly-annotated relative depth information of skeletal joints is available. This further improves the generalization ability of our model, as validated by qualitative comparisons on outdoor images. Leveraging the strength of the HEMlets pose estimation, we further design and append a shallow yet effective network module to regress the SMPL parameters of the body pose and shape.

{"text": "Title: Bring Metric Functions into Diffusion Models\nAbstract: We introduce a Cascaded Diffusion Model (Cas-DM) that improves a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) by effectively incorporating additional metric functions in training. Metric functions such as the LPIPS loss have been proven highly effective in consistency models derived from the score matching. However, for the diffusion counterparts, the methodology and efficacy of adding extra metric functions remain unclear. One major challenge is the mismatch between the noise predicted by a DDPM at each step and the desired clean image that the metric function works well on. To address this problem, we propose Cas-DM, a network architecture that cascades two network modules to effectively apply metric functions to the diffusion model training. The first module, similar to a standard DDPM, learns to predict the added noise and is unaffected by the metric function. The second cascaded module learns to predict the clean image, thereby facilitating the metric function computation.

Unfortunately, risk scores (e.g., from Cox Proportional Hazard models) do not provide survival probabilities, single-time probability models (e.g., the Gail model, predicting 5 year probability) only provide for a single time point, and standard Kaplan-Meier survival curves provide only population averages for a large class of patients meaning they are not specific to individual patients. This motivates an alternative class of tools that can learn a model which provides an individual survival distribution which gives survival probabilities across all times - such as extensions to the Cox model, Accelerated Failure Time, an extension to Random Survival Forests, and Multi-Task Logistic Regression. This paper first motivates such \"individual survival distribution\" (ISD) models, and explains how they differ from standard models. It then discusses ways to evaluate such models - namely Concordance, 1-Calibration, Brier score, and various versions of L1-loss - and then motivates and defines a novel approach \"D-Calibration\", which determines whether a model's probability estimates are meaningful. We also discuss how these measures differ, and use them to evaluate several ISD prediction tools, over a range of survival datasets.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Using Locality-sensitive Hashing for Rendezvous Search\nAbstract: The multichannel rendezvous problem is a fundamental problem for neighbor discovery in many IoT applications. The existing works in the literature focus mostly on improving the worst-case performance, and the average-case performance is often not as good as that of the random algorithm. As IoT devices (users) are close to each other, their available channel sets, though they might be different, are similar. Using the locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) technique in data mining, we propose channel hopping algorithms that exploit the similarity between the two available channel sets to increase the rendezvous probability. For the synchronous setting, our algorithms have the expected time-to-rendezvous (ETTR) inversely proportional to a well-known similarity measure called the Jaccard index. For the asynchronous setting, we use dimensionality reduction to speed up the rendezvous process. Our numerical results show that our algorithms can outperform the random algorithm in terms of ETTR.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

In response to state-linked political manipulation tactics on social media, Twitter and Meta carried out take-down operations against propaganda networks, accusing them of interfering foreign elections, organizing disinformation campaigns, manipulating political debates and many other issues.

{"text": "Title: TR-DETR: Task-Reciprocal Transformer for Joint Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection\nAbstract: Video moment retrieval (MR) and highlight detection (HD) based on natural language queries are two highly related tasks, which aim to obtain relevant moments within videos and highlight scores of each video clip. Recently, several methods have been devoted to building DETR-based networks to solve both MR and HD jointly. These methods simply add two separate task heads after multi-modal feature extraction and feature interaction, achieving good performance. Nevertheless, these approaches underutilize the reciprocal relationship between two tasks. In this paper, we propose a task-reciprocal transformer based on DETR (TR-DETR) that focuses on exploring the inherent reciprocity between MR and HD. Specifically, a local-global multi-modal alignment module is first built to align features from diverse modalities into a shared latent space. Subsequently, a visual feature refinement is designed to eliminate query-irrelevant information from visual features for modal interaction. Finally, a task cooperation module is constructed to refine the retrieval pipeline and the highlight score prediction process by utilizing the reciprocity between MR and HD.

In this paper we determine the strength of the dominant singularities that occur at the interface between materials. By modifying earlier regularity theory for polygonal interfaces we find that on each subdomain, where the material in the fibre is constant, the regularity of in-plane components of the magnetic field are $H^{2-\\eta}$ for all $\\eta > 0$. This estimate is sharp in the sense that these components do not belong to $H^2$, in general. However, global regularity is restricted by the presence of an interface between these subdomains and the interface conditions imply only $H^{3/2-\\eta}$ regularity across the interface. The results are useful to anyone applying a numerical method such as a finite element method or a planewave expansion method to model photonic crystal fibres or similar materials.", "field": "math", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Deplatforming Norm-Violating Influencers on Social Media Reduces Overall Online Attention Toward Them\nAbstract: From politicians to podcast hosts, online platforms have systematically banned (``deplatformed'') influential users for breaking platform guidelines. Previous inquiries on the effectiveness of this intervention are inconclusive because 1) they consider only few deplatforming events; 2) they consider only overt engagement traces (e.g., likes and posts) but not passive engagement (e.g., views); 3) they do not consider all the potential places users impacted by the deplatforming event might migrate to. We address these limitations in a longitudinal, quasi-experimental study of 165 deplatforming events targeted at 101 influencers. We collect deplatforming events from Reddit posts and then manually curate the data, ensuring the correctness of a large dataset of deplatforming events. Then, we link these events to Google Trends and Wikipedia page views, platform-agnostic measures of online attention that capture the general public's interest in specific influencers. Through a difference-in-differences approach, we find that deplatforming reduces online attention toward influencers. After 12 months, we estimate that online attention toward deplatformed influencers is reduced by -63% (95% CI [-75%,-46%]) on Google and by -43% (95% CI [-57%,-24%]) on Wikipedia. Further, as we study over a hundred deplatforming events, we can analyze in which cases deplatforming is more or less impactful, revealing nuances about the intervention. Notably, we find that both permanent and temporary deplatforming reduce online attention toward influencers; Overall, this work contributes to the ongoing effort to map the effectiveness of content moderation interventions, driving platform governance away from speculation.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

Robust regret is defined relative to the performance of this optimal non-causal control. It is shown that a controller achieves robust regret if and only if it satisfies a robust $H_\\infty$ performance condition. DK-iteration can be used to synthesize a controller that satisfies this condition and hence achieve a given level of robust regret. The approach is demonstrated three examples: (i) a simple single-input, single-output classical design, (ii) a longitudinal control for a simplified model for a Boeing 747 model, and (iii) an active suspension for a quarter car model.

We introduce two versions of the RAMCP algorithm. The first, RAMCP-F, converges to an optimal risk-sensitive policy without having to rebuild the search tree as the underlying belief over models is perturbed.

However, the rigorous proof for the existence and convergence of the boundary layer solutions to the proposed model still remains open. This paper shows that the model with physical boundary conditions proposed in \\cite{tuval2005bacterial} in one dimension can generate boundary layer solution as the oxygen diffusion rate $\\varepsilon>0$ is small. Specifically, we show that the solution of the model with $\\varepsilon>0$ will converge to the solution with $\\varepsilon=0$ (outer-layer solution) plus the boundary layer profiles (inner-layer solution) with a sharp transition near the boundary as $ \\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$. There are two major difficulties in our analysis. First, the global well-posedness of the model is hard to prove since the Dirichlet boundary condition can not contribute to the gradient estimates needed for the cross-diffusion structure in the model. Resorting to the technique of taking anti-derivative, we remove the cross-diffusion structure such that the Dirichlet boundary condition can facilitate the needed estimates. Second, the outer-layer profile of bacterial density is required to be degenerate at the boundary as $ t \\rightarrow 0 ^{+}$, which makes the traditional cancellation technique incapable.

In this paper, we introduce \\texttt{LaDe}, the first publicly available last-mile delivery dataset with millions of packages from the industry. LaDe has three unique characteristics: (1) Large-scale. It involves 10,677k packages of 21k couriers over 6 months of real-world operation. (2) Comprehensive information. It offers original package information, such as its location and time requirements, as well as task-event information, which records when and where the courier is while events such as task-accept and task-finish events happen. (3) Diversity. The dataset includes data from various scenarios, including package pick-up and delivery, and from multiple cities, each with its unique spatio-temporal patterns due to their distinct characteristics such as populations. We verify LaDe on three tasks by running several classical baseline models per task. We believe that the large-scale, comprehensive, diverse feature of LaDe can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the supply chain community, data mining community, and beyond.

Edges are indeed effectively delineated by pixel discontinuity and can offer reliable structural information even in textureless areas. State-of-the-art heavily relies on pixel-wise annotations, which are labor-intensive and subject to inconsistencies when acquired manually. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised approach for edge detection that employs a multi-level, multi-homography technique to transfer annotations from synthetic to real-world datasets. To fully leverage the generated edge annotations, we developed SuperEdge, a streamlined yet efficient model capable of concurrently extracting edges at pixel-level and object-level granularity. Thanks to self-supervised training, our method eliminates the dependency on manual annotated edge labels, thereby enhancing its generalizability across diverse datasets.

Leakage detection is a difficult task due to the complex dynamics of water distribution networks. In particular, small leakages are hard to detect. From a machine-learning perspective, leakages can be modeled as concept drift. Thus, a wide variety of drift detection schemes seems to be a suitable choice for detecting leakages. In this work, we explore the potential of model-loss-based and distribution-based drift detection methods to tackle leakage detection. We additionally discuss the issue of temporal dependencies in the data and propose a way to cope with it when applying distribution-based detection. We evaluate different methods systematically for leakages of different sizes and detection times.

A lightweight, compliant and user-specific actuator is critical for maximizing the benefits of an exoskeleton to users. To date, pediatric exoskeletons generally use the same actuators as adult exoskeletons, which are heavy and resistive to natural movement. There is yet no easy way for robotic exoskeletons to accommodate the changes in design requirements that occur as a child ages. We developed a lightweight (1.65 kg unilateral mass) and compliant pediatric knee exoskeleton with a bandwidth of 22.6 Hz that can provide torque assistance to children with crouch gait using high torque density motor. Experimental results demonstrated that the robot exhibited low mechanical impedance (1.79 Nm average backdrive torque) under the unpowered condition and 0.32 Nm with zero-torque tracking control. Root mean square (RMS) error of torque tracking result is less than 0.73 Nm (5.7% with respect to 12 Nm torque). To achieve optimal age-specific performance, we proposed the first optimization framework that considered both motor and transmission of the actuator system that can produce optimal settings for children between 3 and 18 years old. The optimization generated an optimal motor air gap radius that monotonically increases with age from 0.011 to 0.033 meters, and optimal gear ratio varies from 2.6 to 11.6 (3-13 years old) and 11.6 to 10.2 (13-18 years old), leading to actuators of minimal mass.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

We consider serial and parallel implementations of both methods for single and multiple core computations on a desktop machine as well as the Beskow supercomputer at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.

Our algorithm also allows the system designer to lower the welfare requirements in order to achieve a higher degree of fairness.

{"text": "Title: A Generalized Variable Projection Algorithm for Least Squares Problems in Atmospheric Remote Sensing\nAbstract: This paper presents a solution for efficiently and accurately solving separable least squares problems with multiple datasets. These problems involve determining linear parameters that are specific to each dataset while ensuring that the nonlinear parameters remain consistent across all datasets. A well-established approach for solving such problems is the variable projection algorithm introduced by Golub and LeVeque, which effectively reduces a separable problem to its nonlinear component. However, this algorithm assumes that the datasets have equal sizes and identical auxiliary model parameters. This article is motivated by a real-world remote sensing application where these assumptions do not apply. Consequently, we propose a generalized algorithm that extends the original theory to overcome these limitations. The new algorithm has been implemented and tested using both synthetic and real satellite data for atmospheric carbon dioxide retrievals. It has also been compared to conventional state-of-the-art solvers, and its advantages are thoroughly discussed. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms all other methods in terms of computation time, while maintaining comparable accuracy and stability. Hence, this novel method can have a positive impact on future applications in remote sensing and could be valuable for other scientific fitting problems with similar properties.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

We show that the switching rate provides a powerful mechanism for controlling the densities of spontaneously emerging aggregates. Specifically, in two- and three-dimensional settings it is shown that when both switching rates coincide and are suitably large, then the densities of both the chemotaxing and the secreting population will exceed any prescribed level at some points in the considered domain. This is complemented by two results asserting the absence of such aggregation phenomena in corresponding scenarios in which one of the switching rates remains within some bounded interval.", "field": "math", "label": 1}

Further, the mesh is updated at each iteration of the structural optimization process by a pseudo-elastic moving mesh method. In this procedure, the existing mesh is deformed to match the updated surface and therefore reduces the need for remeshing.

{"text": "Title: DEWP: Deep Expansion Learning for Wind Power Forecasting\nAbstract: Wind is one kind of high-efficient, environmentally-friendly and cost-effective energy source. Wind power, as one of the largest renewable energy in the world, has been playing a more and more important role in supplying electricity. Though growing dramatically in recent years, the amount of generated wind power can be directly or latently affected by multiple uncertain factors, such as wind speed, wind direction, temperatures, etc. More importantly, there exist very complicated dependencies of the generated power on the latent composition of these multiple time-evolving variables, which are always ignored by existing works and thus largely hinder the prediction performances. To this end, we propose DEWP, a novel Deep Expansion learning for Wind Power forecasting framework to carefully model the complicated dependencies with adequate expressiveness. DEWP starts with a stack-by-stack architecture, where each stack is composed of (i) a variable expansion block that makes use of convolutional layers to capture dependencies among multiple variables; (ii) a time expansion block that applies Fourier series and backcast/forecast mechanism to learn temporal dependencies in sequential patterns. These two tailored blocks expand raw inputs into different latent feature spaces which can model different levels of dependencies of time-evolving sequential data. Moreover, we propose an inference block corresponding for each stack, which applies multi-head self-attentions to acquire attentive features and maps expanded latent representations into generated wind power. In addition, to make DEWP more expressive in handling deep neural architectures, we adapt doubly residue learning to process stack-by-stack outputs. Finally, we present extensive experiments in the real-world wind power forecasting application on two datasets from two different turbines to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: A quatum inspired neural network for geometric modeling\nAbstract: By conceiving physical systems as 3D many-body point clouds, geometric graph neural networks (GNNs), such as SE(3)/E(3) equivalent GNNs, have showcased promising performance. In particular, their effective message-passing mechanics make them adept at modeling molecules and crystalline materials. However, current geometric GNNs only offer a mean-field approximation of the many-body system, encapsulated within two-body message passing, thus falling short in capturing intricate relationships within these geometric graphs. To address this limitation, tensor networks, widely employed by computational physics to handle manybody systems using high-order tensors, have been introduced. Nevertheless, integrating these tensorized networks into the message-passing framework of GNNs faces scalability and symmetry conservation (e.g., permutation and rotation) challenges. In response, we introduce an innovative equivariant Matrix Product State (MPS)-based message-passing strategy, through achieving an efficient implementation of the tensor contraction operation. Our method effectively models complex many-body relationships, suppressing mean-field approximations, and captures symmetries within geometric graphs. Importantly, it seamlessly replaces the standard message-passing and layer-aggregation modules intrinsic to geometric GNNs. We empirically validate the superior accuracy of our approach on benchmark tasks, including predicting classical Newton systems and quantum tensor Hamiltonian matrices.

In the strongly-convex case, we provide an asymptotic expansion up to explicit exponentially decaying terms.

{"text": "Title: Age-Aware Dynamic Frame Slotted ALOHA for Machine-Type Communications\nAbstract: Information aging has gained prominence in characterizing communication protocols for timely remote estimation and control applications. This work proposes an Age of Information (AoI)-aware threshold-based dynamic frame slotted ALOHA (T-DFSA) for contention resolution in random access machine-type communication networks. Unlike conventional DFSA that maximizes the throughput in each frame, the frame length and age-gain threshold in T-DFSA are determined to minimize the normalized average AoI reduction of the network in each frame. At the start of each frame in the proposed protocol, the common Access Point (AP) stores an estimate of the age-gain distribution of a typical node. Depending on the observed status of the slots, age-gains of successful nodes, and maximum available AoI, the AP adjusts its estimation in each frame. The maximum available AoI is exploited to derive the maximum possible age-gain at each frame and thus, to avoid overestimating the age-gain threshold, which may render T-DFSA unstable.

Previous studies on emotion recognition based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals mainly rely on single-channel-based feature extraction methods. In this paper, we propose a novel emotion-relevant critical subnetwork selection algorithm and investigate three EEG functional connectivity network features: strength, clustering coefficient, and eigenvector centrality. The discrimination ability of the EEG connectivity features in emotion recognition is evaluated on three public emotion EEG datasets: SEED, SEED-V, and DEAP. The strength feature achieves the best classification performance and outperforms the state-of-the-art differential entropy feature based on single-channel analysis. The experimental results reveal that distinct functional connectivity patterns are exhibited for the five emotions of disgust, fear, sadness, happiness, and neutrality. Furthermore, we construct a multimodal emotion recognition model by combining the functional connectivity features from EEG and the features from eye movements or physiological signals using deep canonical correlation analysis. The classification accuracies of multimodal emotion recognition are 95.08/6.42% on the SEED dataset, 84.51/5.11% on the SEED-V dataset, and 85.34/2.90% and 86.61/3.76% for arousal and valence on the DEAP dataset, respectively.

Still, their robustness to real-world perturbations and object types not seen during training remains a challenge, particularly in safety-critical applications. We propose a novel approach to improve the robustness of semantic segmentation techniques by leveraging the synergy between label-to-image generators and image-to-label segmentation models. Specifically, we design Robusta, a novel robust conditional generative adversarial network to generate realistic and plausible perturbed images that can be used to train reliable segmentation models. We conduct in-depth studies of the proposed generative model, assess the performance and robustness of the downstream segmentation network, and demonstrate that our approach can significantly enhance the robustness in the face of real-world perturbations, distribution shifts, and out-of-distribution samples. Our results suggest that this approach could be valuable in safety-critical applications, where the reliability of perception modules such as semantic segmentation is of utmost importance and comes with a limited computational budget in inference.

{"text": "Title: Homogenization and nonselfadjoint spectral optimization for dissipative Maxwell eigenproblems\nAbstract: The homogenization of eigenvalues of non-Hermitian Maxwell operators is studied by the H-convergence method. It is assumed that the Maxwell systems are equipped with suitable m-dissipative boundary conditions, namely, with Leontovich or generalized impedance boundary conditions of the form $n \\times E = Z [(n \\times H )\\times n ] $. We show that, for a wide class of impedance operators $Z$, the nonzero spectrum of the corresponding Maxwell operator is discrete. To this end, a new continuous embedding theorem for domains of Maxwell operators is obtained. We prove the convergence of eigenvalues to an eigenvalue of a homogenized Maxwell operator under the assumption of the H-convergence of the material tensor-fields. This result is applied then to the existence of optimizers for eigenvalue optimization problems and to the existence of an eigenvalue-free region around zero. Connections with unique (and nonunique) continuation results are discussed.", "field": "math", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Stochastic Analysis of an Adaptive Cubic Regularisation Method under Inexact Gradient Evaluations and Dynamic Hessian Accuracy\nAbstract: We here adapt an extended version of the adaptive cubic regularisation method with dynamic inexact Hessian information for nonconvex optimisation in [3] to the stochastic optimisation setting. While exact function evaluations are still considered, this novel variant inherits the innovative use of adaptive accuracy requirements for Hessian approximations introduced in [3] and additionally employs inexact computations of the gradient. Without restrictions on the variance of the errors, we assume that these approximations are available within a sufficiently large, but fixed, probability and we extend, in the spirit of [18], the deterministic analysis of the framework to its stochastic counterpart, showing that the expected number of iterations to reach a first-order stationary point matches the well known worst-case optimal complexity. This is, in fact, still given by O(epsilon^(-3/2)), with respect to the first-order epsilon tolerance. Finally, numerical tests on nonconvex finite-sum minimisation confirm that using inexact first and second-order derivatives can be beneficial in terms of the computational savings.", "field": "math", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: SwitchTab: Switched Autoencoders Are Effective Tabular Learners\nAbstract: Self-supervised representation learning methods have achieved significant success in computer vision and natural language processing, where data samples exhibit explicit spatial or semantic dependencies. However, applying these methods to tabular data is challenging due to the less pronounced dependencies among data samples. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing SwitchTab, a novel self-supervised method specifically designed to capture latent dependencies in tabular data. SwitchTab leverages an asymmetric encoder-decoder framework to decouple mutual and salient features among data pairs, resulting in more representative embeddings. These embeddings, in turn, contribute to better decision boundaries and lead to improved results in downstream tasks. To validate the effectiveness of SwitchTab, we conduct extensive experiments across various domains involving tabular data. The results showcase superior performance in end-to-end prediction tasks with fine-tuning. Moreover, we demonstrate that pre-trained salient embeddings can be utilized as plug-and-play features to enhance the performance of various traditional classification methods (e.g., Logistic Regression, XGBoost, etc.). Lastly, we highlight the capability of SwitchTab to create explainable representations through visualization of decoupled mutual and salient features in the latent space.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: (Universal) Unconditional Verifiability in E-Voting without Trusted Parties\nAbstract: In traditional e-voting protocols, privacy is often provided by a trusted authority that learns the votes and computes the tally. Some protocols replace the trusted authority by a set of authorities, and privacy is guaranteed if less than a threshold number of authorities are corrupt. For verifiability, stronger security guarantees are demanded. Typically, corrupt authorities that try to fake the result of the tally must always be detected. To provide verifiability, many e-voting protocols use Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge proofs (NIZKs). Thanks to their non-interactive nature, NIZKs allow anybody, including third parties that do not participate in the protocol, to verify the correctness of the tally. Therefore, NIZKs can be used to obtain universal verifiability. Additionally, NIZKs also improve usability because they allow voters to cast a vote using a non-interactive protocol. The disadvantage of NIZKs is that their security is based on setup assumptions such as the common reference string (CRS) or the random oracle (RO) model. The former requires a trusted party for the generation of a common reference string. The latter, though a popular methodology for designing secure protocols, has been shown to be unsound. In this paper, we address the design of an e-voting protocol that provides verifiability without any trust assumptions, where verifiability here is meant without eligibility verification. We show that Non-Interactive Witness-Indistinguishable proofs (NIWI) can be used for this purpose. The e-voting scheme is private under the Decision Linear assumption, while verifiability holds unconditionally. To our knowledge, this is the first private e-voting scheme with perfect universal verifiability, i.e. one in which the probability of a fake tally not being detected is 0, and with {\\em non-interactive} protocols that does not rely on trust assumptions.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

Approximate expressions for the uplink SINR are provided for the iterative data-aided method as well.

Modeling-wise, we show how Heaviside composite optimization provides a unified formulation for learning the optimal multi-class classification and multi-action treatment rules, subject to rule-dependent constraints stipulating a variety of domain restrictions. A Heaviside composite function has an equivalent discrete formulation %in terms of integer variables, and the resulting optimization problem can in principle be solved by integer programming (IP) methods. Nevertheless, for constrained learning problems with large data sets, %of modest or large sizes, a straightforward application of off-the-shelf IP solvers is usually ineffective in achieving global optimality. To alleviate such a computational burden, our major contribution is the proposal of the PIP method by leveraging the effectiveness of state-of-the-art IP solvers for problems of modest sizes. We provide the theoretical advantage of the PIP method with the connection to continuous optimization and show that the computed solution is locally optimal for a broad class of Heaviside composite optimization problems. The numerical performance of the PIP method is demonstrated by extensive computational experimentation.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

However, the single-side coverage and double-fading attenuation faced by conventional RISs largely restrict their applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel concept of multi-functional RIS (MF-RIS), which provides reflection, transmission, and amplification simultaneously for the incident signal. With the aim of enhancing the performance of a non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) downlink multiuser network, we deploy an MF-RIS to maximize the sum rate by jointly optimizing the active beamforming and MF-RIS coefficients. Then, an alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the formulated non-convex problem by exploiting successive convex approximation and penalty-based method. Numerical results show that the proposed MF-RIS outperforms conventional RISs under different settings.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Fast Certification of Vision-Language Models Using Incremental Randomized Smoothing\nAbstract: A key benefit of deep vision-language models such as CLIP is that they enable zero-shot open vocabulary classification; the user has the ability to define novel class labels via natural language prompts at inference time. However, while CLIP-based zero-shot classifiers have demonstrated competitive performance across a range of domain shifts, they remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Therefore, ensuring the robustness of such models is crucial for their reliable deployment in the wild. In this work, we introduce Open Vocabulary Certification (OVC), a fast certification method designed for open-vocabulary models like CLIP via randomized smoothing techniques. Given a base \"training\" set of prompts and their corresponding certified CLIP classifiers, OVC relies on the observation that a classifier with a novel prompt can be viewed as a perturbed version of nearby classifiers in the base training set. Therefore, OVC can rapidly certify the novel classifier using a variation of incremental randomized smoothing. By using a caching trick, we achieve approximately two orders of magnitude acceleration in the certification process for novel prompts. To achieve further (heuristic) speedups, OVC approximates the embedding space at a given input using a multivariate normal distribution bypassing the need for sampling via forward passes through the vision backbone. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OVC on through experimental evaluation using multiple vision-language backbones on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet test datasets.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

While Arbault sets can be naturally associated with the Frechet ideal $Fin$, in \\cite{DGT} it was observed that when $Fin$ is replaced by the natural density ideal $\\mathcal{I}_d$ one can obtain a strictly larger class of trigonometric thin sets containing Arbault sets. From the set theoretic point of view a natural question arises as whether one can broaden the picture and specify a class of ideals (instead of a single ideal) each of which would have the similar effect. As a natural candidate, we focus on a special class of ideals, namely, non-$snt$ ideals ($snt$ stands for ``strongly non translation invariant\") which properly contains the class of translation invariant ideals ($\\varsupsetneq Fin$) and happens to contain ideals generated by simple density functions as also certain non-negative regular summability matrices (but not all) which can be seen from \\cite{DG6}.

{"text": "Title: Existence of solutions to the nonlinear equations characterizing the precise error of M-estimators\nAbstract: Major progress has been made in the previous decade to characterize the asymptotic behavior of regularized M-estimators in high-dimensional regression problems in the proportional asymptotic regime where the sample size $n$ and the number of features $p$ are increasing simultaneously such that $n/p\\to \\delta \\in(0,\\infty)$, using powerful tools such as Approximate Message Passing or the Convex Gaussian Min-Max Theorem (CGMT). The asymptotic error and behavior of the regularized M-estimator is then typically described by a system of nonlinear equations with a few scalar unknowns, and the solution to this system precisely characterize the asymptotic error. Application of the CGMT and related machinery requires the existence of a solution to this low-dimensional system of equations. This paper resolves the question of existence of solution to this low-dimensional system for the case of linear models with independent additive noise, when both the data-fitting loss function and regularization penalty are separable and convex. Such existence result for solution to the nonlinear system were previously known under strong convexity for specific estimators such as the Lasso.

{"text": "Title: Person Re-identification: Implicitly Defining the Receptive Fields of Deep Learning Classification Frameworks\nAbstract: The \\emph{receptive fields} of deep learning classification models determine the regions of the input data that have the most significance for providing correct decisions. The primary way to learn such receptive fields is to train the models upon masked data, which helps the networks to ignore any unwanted regions, but has two major drawbacks: 1) it often yields edge-sensitive decision processes; and 2) augments the computational cost of the inference phase considerably. This paper describes a solution for implicitly driving the inference of the networks' receptive fields, by creating synthetic learning data composed of interchanged segments that should be \\emph{apriori} important/irrelevant for the network decision. In practice, we use a segmentation module to distinguish between the foreground (important)/background (irrelevant) parts of each learning instance, and randomly swap segments between image pairs, while keeping the class label exclusively consistent with the label of the deemed important segments. This strategy typically drives the networks to early convergence and appropriate solutions, where the identity and clutter descriptions are not correlated. Moreover, this data augmentation solution has various interesting properties: 1) it is parameter-free; 2) it fully preserves the label information; and, 3) it is compatible with the typical data augmentation techniques. In the empirical validation, we considered the person re-identification problem and evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed solution in the well-known \\emph{Richly Annotated Pedestrian} (RAP) dataset for two different settings (\\emph{upper-body} and \\emph{full-body}), observing highly competitive results over the state-of-the-art.

{"text": "Title: Acyclicity of Preferences, Nash Equilibria, and Subgame Perfect Equilibria: a Formal and Constructive Equivalence\nAbstract: In 1953, Kuhn showed that every sequential game has a Nash equilibrium by showing that a procedure, named ``backward induction'' in game theory, yields a Nash equilibrium. It actually yields Nash equilibria that define a proper subclass of Nash equilibria. In 1965, Selten named this proper subclass subgame perfect equilibria. In game theory, payoffs are rewards usually granted at the end of a game. Although traditional game theory mainly focuses on real-valued payoffs that are implicitly ordered by the usual total order over the reals, works of Simon or Blackwell already involved partially ordered payoffs. This paper generalises the notion of sequential game by replacing real-valued payoff functions with abstract atomic objects, called outcomes, and by replacing the usual total order over the reals with arbitrary binary relations over outcomes, called preferences. This introduces a general abstract formalism where Nash equilibrium, subgame perfect equilibrium, and ``backward induction'' can still be defined. This paper proves that the following three propositions are equivalent: 1) Preferences over the outcomes are acyclic. 2) Every sequential game has a Nash equilibrium. 3) Every sequential game has a subgame perfect equilibrium. The result is fully computer-certified using Coq. Beside the additional guarantee of correctness, the activity of formalisation using Coq also helps clearly identify the useful definitions and the main articulations of the proof.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: The Implicit Bias of Benign Overfitting\nAbstract: The phenomenon of benign overfitting, where a predictor perfectly fits noisy training data while attaining near-optimal expected loss, has received much attention in recent years, but still remains not fully understood beyond well-specified linear regression setups. In this paper, we provide several new results on when one can or cannot expect benign overfitting to occur, for both regression and classification tasks. We consider a prototypical and rather generic data model for benign overfitting of linear predictors, where an arbitrary input distribution of some fixed dimension $k$ is concatenated with a high-dimensional distribution. For linear regression which is not necessarily well-specified, we show that the minimum-norm interpolating predictor (that standard training methods converge to) is biased towards an inconsistent solution in general, hence benign overfitting will generally not occur. Moreover, we show how this can be extended beyond standard linear regression, by an argument proving how the existence of benign overfitting on some regression problems precludes its existence on other regression problems. We then turn to classification problems, and show that the situation there is much more favorable. Specifically, we prove that the max-margin predictor (to which standard training methods are known to converge in direction) is asymptotically biased towards minimizing a weighted \\emph{squared hinge loss}. This allows us to reduce the question of benign overfitting in classification to the simpler question of whether this loss is a good surrogate for the misclassification error, and use it to show benign overfitting in some new settings.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Periodic Strategies II: Generalizations and Extensions\nAbstract: At a mixed Nash equilibrium, the payoff of a player does not depend on her own action, as long as her opponent sticks to his. In a periodic strategy, a concept developed in a previous paper (arXiv:1307.2035v4), in contrast, the own payoff does not depend on the opponent's action. Here, we generalize this to multi-player simultaneous perfect information strategic form games. We show that also in this class of games, there always exists at least one periodic strategy, and we investigate the mathematical properties of such periodic strategies. In addition, we demonstrate that periodic strategies may exist in games with incomplete information; we shall focus on Bayesian games. Moreover we discuss the differences between the periodic strategies formalism and cooperative game theory. In fact, the periodic strategies are obtained in a purely non-cooperative way, and periodic strategies are as cooperative as the Nash equilibria are. Finally, we incorporate the periodic strategies in an epistemic game theory framework, and discuss several features of this approach.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Stochastic Approximation Approaches to Group Distributionally Robust Optimization\nAbstract: This paper investigates group distributionally robust optimization (GDRO), with the purpose to learn a model that performs well over $m$ different distributions. First, we formulate GDRO as a stochastic convex-concave saddle-point problem, and demonstrate that stochastic mirror descent (SMD), using $m$ samples in each iteration, achieves an $O(m (\\log m)/\\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity for finding an $\\epsilon$-optimal solution, which matches the $\\Omega(m/\\epsilon^2)$ lower bound up to a logarithmic factor. Then, we make use of techniques from online learning to reduce the number of samples required in each round from $m$ to $1$, keeping the same sample complexity. Specifically, we cast GDRO as a two-players game where one player simply performs SMD and the other executes an online algorithm for non-oblivious multi-armed bandits. Next, we consider a more practical scenario where the number of samples that can be drawn from each distribution is different, and propose a novel formulation of weighted GDRO, which allows us to derive distribution-dependent convergence rates. Denote by $n_i$ the sample budget for the $i$-th distribution, and assume $n_1 \\geq n_2 \\geq \\cdots \\geq n_m$. In the first approach, we incorporate non-uniform sampling into SMD such that the sample budget is satisfied in expectation, and prove that the excess risk of the $i$-th distribution decreases at an $O(\\sqrt{n_1 \\log m}/n_i)$ rate. In the second approach, we use mini-batches to meet the budget exactly and also reduce the variance in stochastic gradients, and then leverage stochastic mirror-prox algorithm, which can exploit small variances, to optimize a carefully designed weighted GDRO problem. Under appropriate conditions, it attains an $O((\\log m)/\\sqrt{n_i})$ convergence rate, which almost matches the optimal $O(\\sqrt{1/n_i})$ rate of only learning from the $i$-th distribution with $n_i$ samples.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: LLM Augmented LLMs: Expanding Capabilities through Composition\nAbstract: Foundational models with billions of parameters which have been trained on large corpora of data have demonstrated non-trivial skills in a variety of domains. However, due to their monolithic structure, it is challenging and expensive to augment them or impart new skills. On the other hand, due to their adaptation abilities, several new instances of these models are being trained towards new domains and tasks. In this work, we study the problem of efficient and practical composition of existing foundation models with more specific models to enable newer capabilities. To this end, we propose CALM -- Composition to Augment Language Models -- which introduces cross-attention between models to compose their representations and enable new capabilities. Salient features of CALM are: (i) Scales up LLMs on new tasks by 're-using' existing LLMs along with a few additional parameters and data, (ii) Existing model weights are kept intact, and hence preserves existing capabilities, and (iii) Applies to diverse domains and settings. We illustrate that augmenting PaLM2-S with a smaller model trained on low-resource languages results in an absolute improvement of up to 13\\% on tasks like translation into English and arithmetic reasoning for low-resource languages.

{"text": "Title: Act as You Learn: Adaptive Decision-Making in Non-Stationary Markov Decision Processes\nAbstract: A fundamental (and largely open) challenge in sequential decision-making is dealing with non-stationary environments, where exogenous environmental conditions change over time. Such problems are traditionally modeled as non-stationary Markov decision processes (NSMDP). However, existing approaches for decision-making in NSMDPs have two major shortcomings: first, they assume that the updated environmental dynamics at the current time are known (although future dynamics can change); and second, planning is largely pessimistic, i.e., the agent acts ``safely'' to account for the non-stationary evolution of the environment. We argue that both these assumptions are invalid in practice -- updated environmental conditions are rarely known, and as the agent interacts with the environment, it can learn about the updated dynamics and avoid being pessimistic, at least in states whose dynamics it is confident about. We present a heuristic search algorithm called \\textit{Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree Search (ADA-MCTS)} that addresses these challenges. We show that the agent can learn the updated dynamics of the environment over time and then act as it learns, i.e., if the agent is in a region of the state space about which it has updated knowledge, it can avoid being pessimistic. To quantify ``updated knowledge,'' we disintegrate the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in the agent's updated belief and show how the agent can use these estimates for decision-making. We compare the proposed approach with the multiple state-of-the-art approaches in decision-making across multiple well-established open-source problems and empirically show that our approach is faster and highly adaptive without sacrificing safety.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Theory inspired deep network for instantaneous-frequency extraction and signal components recovery from discrete blind-source data\nAbstract: This paper is concerned with the inverse problem of recovering the unknown signal components, along with extraction of their instantaneous frequencies (IFs), governed by the adaptive harmonic model (AHM), from discrete (and possibly non-uniform) samples of the blind-source composite signal. None of the existing decomposition methods and algorithms, including the most popular empirical mode decomposition (EMD) computational scheme and its current modifications, is capable of solving this inverse problem. In order to meet the AHM formulation and to extract the IFs of the decomposed components, called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), each IMF of EMD is extended to an analytic function in the upper half of the complex plane via the Hilbert transform, followed by taking the real part of the polar form of the analytic extension. Unfortunately, this approach most often fails to resolve the inverse problem satisfactorily. More recently, to resolve the inverse problem, the notion of synchrosqueezed wavelet transform (SST) was proposed by Daubechies and Maes, and further developed in many other papers, while a more direct method, called signal separation operation (SSO), was proposed and developed in our previous work published in the journal, Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis, vol. 30(2):243-261, 2016. In the present paper, we propose a synthesis of SSO using a deep neural network, based directly on a discrete sample set, that may be non-uniformly sampled, of the blind-source signal. Our method is localized, as illustrated by a number of numerical examples, including components with different signal arrival and departure times. It also yields short-term prediction of the signal components, along with their IFs. Our neural networks are inspired by theory, designed so that they do not require any training in the traditional sense.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Travelers: A scalable fair ordering BFT system\nAbstract: Many blockchain platform are subject to maximal value extraction (MEV), and users on the platform are losing money while sending transactions because the transaction order can be manipulated to extract value from them. Consensus protocols have been augmented with different notion of fair ordering in order to counter the problem. Out of all practical protocols, the most efficient BFT consensus requires $O(nTL + n^2T)$ communication complexity, where $n$ is number node, $T$ is number of transactions and $L$ is average transaction size. In this work, we propose a new system of BFT fair ordering protocols, Travelers, that substantially reduce the communication complexity. The proposed system of protocols satisfy a new notion of fair ordering, called probabilistic fair ordering, which is an extension to some existing notions of fairness. The new notion allows a small probability of error $\\epsilon$, that adversary can insert some transactions at any location in a block, but for the remaining $1-\\epsilon$ the a modified version of ordering linearizability holds.

The model accounts for phase transitions assumed to be at thermodynamical equilibrium and is based on an hydrodynamical Drift Flux Model (DFM) combined with a No Pressure Wave approximation of the momentum equation. The focus of this work is on the design of a robust discretization accounting for slanted and multibranch wells with the ability to simulate both transient behavior such as well opening as well as coupled simulations at the time scale of the reservoir. It is based on a staggered finite volume scheme in space combined with a fully implicit Euler time integration. The construction of consistent and stable numerical fluxes is a key feature for a robust numerical method. It is achieved by combining a monotone flux approximation for the phase superficial velocities with an upwind approximation of the phase molar fractions, density and enthalpy. In order to facilitate the coupling of the well and reservoir models, the Newton linearization accounts for the elimination of the hydrodynamical unknowns leading to Jacobian systems using the same primary unknowns than those of the reservoir model.

This has limited their applications in many scenarios (e.g., autonomous systems, supersonic flows) that have a limited energy budget and require near real-time response. Leveraging optical computing, this paper develops an on-chip training framework for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), aiming to solve high-dimensional PDEs with fJ/MAC photonic power consumption and ultra-low latency. Despite the ultra-high speed of optical neural networks, training a PINN on an optical chip is hard due to (1) the large size of photonic devices, and (2) the lack of scalable optical memory devices to store the intermediate results of back-propagation (BP). To enable realistic optical PINN training, this paper presents a scalable method to avoid the BP process. We also employ a tensor-compressed approach to improve the convergence and scalability of our optical PINN training. This training framework is designed with tensorized optical neural networks (TONN) for scalable inference acceleration and MZI phase-domain tuning for \\textit{in-situ} optimization.

Cross-validation gives an unbiased estimate of the risk (for the present sample size n) with a given penalty parameter, and this function can be minimized as a function of the penalty parameter. Least-squares cross-validation, which has been proposed for the similar Deconvoluting Kernel Density Estimator (DKDE), performs quite poorly for SPeD. We instead estimate the risk function for a smaller sample size n_1 < n with a given penalty parameter, using this to choose the penalty parameter for sample size n_1, and then use the asymptotics of the optimal penalty parameter to choose for sample size n. In a simulation study, we find that this has dramatically better performance than cross-validation, is an improvement over a SURE-type method previously proposed for this estimator, and compares favorably to the classic DKDE with its recommended plug-in method.

However, a large number of antennas deployed in massive MIMO-ISAC raises critical challenges in acquiring both accurate channel state information and target parameter information. To overcome these two challenges with a unified framework, we first analyze their underlying system models and then propose a novel tensor-based approach that addresses both the channel estimation and target sensing problems. Specifically, by parameterizing the high-dimensional communication channel exploiting a small number of physical parameters, we associate the channel state information with the sensing parameters of targets in terms of angular, delay, and Doppler dimensions. Then, we propose a shared training pattern adopting the same time-frequency resources such that both the channel estimation and target parameter estimation can be formulated as a canonical polyadic decomposition problem with a similar mathematical expression.

First, in dimension two, we extend to a prime power setting and to the whole rigid projective line a recent result of Bergdall, Levin and Liu concerning reductions of semi-stable representations of $\\text{Gal}(\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}_p / \\mathbb{Q}_p)$ with fixed Hodge-Tate weights and large $\\mathcal{L}$-invariant. Second, in dimension $d$, let $V_n$ be a sequence of crystalline representations converging in a certain geometric sense to a crystalline representation $V$. We show that for any refined version $(V, \\sigma)$ of $V$ (or equivalently for any chosen triangulation of its attached $(\\varphi, \\Gamma)$-module $D_{\\text{rig}} (V)$ over the Robba ring), there exists a sequence of refinement $\\sigma_n$ of each of the $V_n$ such that the limit as refined representations $(V_n , \\sigma_n )$ converges to the $(V, \\sigma)$. This result does not hold under the weaker assumption that $V_n$ converges only uniformly $p$-adically to $V$ (in the sense of Chenevier, Khare and Larsen).", "field": "math", "label": 0}

Surprisingly, despite the effect of noise on the population, it does not seem to evolve away. We carry out further analysis and provide reasons for why this may be the case.

{"text": "Title: Singularity-agnostic incomplete U-statistics for testing polynomial constraints in Gaussian covariance matrices\nAbstract: Testing the goodness-of-fit of a model with its defining functional constraints in the parameters could date back to Spearman (1927), who analyzed the famous \"tetrad\" polynomial in the covariance matrix of the observed variables in a single-factor model. Despite its long history, the Wald test typically employed to operationalize this approach could produce very inaccurate test sizes in many situations, even when the regular conditions for the classical normal asymptotics are met and a very large sample is available. Focusing on testing a polynomial constraint in a Gaussian covariance matrix, we obtained a new understanding of this baffling phenomenon: When the null hypothesis is true but \"near-singular\", the standardized Wald test exhibits slow weak convergence, owing to the sophisticated dependency structure inherent to the underlying U-statistic that ultimately drives its limiting distribution; this can also be rigorously explained by a key ratio of moments encoded in the Berry-Esseen bound quantifying the normal approximation error involved. As an alternative, we advocate the use of an incomplete U-statistic to mildly tone down the dependence thereof and render the speed of convergence agnostic to the singularity status of the hypothesis. In parallel, we develop a Berry-Esseen bound that is mathematically descriptive of the singularity-agnostic nature of our standardized incomplete U-statistic, using some of the finest exponential-type inequalities in the literature.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

The TPCx-BB specification describes several business use cases -- queries -- which require a broad combination of data extraction techniques including SQL, Map/Reduce (M/R), user code (UDF), and Machine Learning to fulfill them. However, currently, there is no widespread knowledge of the different resource requirements and expected performance of each query, as is the case to more established benchmarks. At the same time, cloud providers currently offer convenient on-demand managed big data clusters (PaaS) with a pay-as-you-go model. In PaaS, analytical engines such as Hive and Spark come ready to use, with a general-purpose configuration and upgrade management. The study characterizes both the BigBench queries and the out-of-the-box performance of Spark and Hive versions in the cloud. At the same time, comparing popular PaaS offerings in terms of reliability, data scalability (1GB to 10TB), versions, and settings from Azure HDinsight, Amazon Web Services EMR, and Google Cloud Dataproc.

Scalability results show how there is a need for configuration tuning in most cloud providers as data scale grows, especially with Sparks memory usage.

We prove that $R_{x_0}$ has a multifractal behavior also when $x_0$ is irrational.

{"text": "Title: Rational trigonometry via projective geometric algebra\nAbstract: We show that main results of rational trigonometry (as developed by NJ Wildberger, \"Divine Proportions\", 2005) can be succinctly expressed using projective geometric algebra (PGA). In fact, the PGA representation exhibits distinct advantages over the original vector-based approach. These include the advantages intrinsic to geometric algebra: it is coordinate-free, treats lines and points in a unified framework, and handles many special cases in a uniform and seamless fashion. It also reveals structural patterns not visible in the original formulation, for example, the exact duality of spread and quadrance. The current article handles only a representative (euclidean) subset of the full content of Wildberger's work, but enough to establish the value of this approach for further development. The metric-neutral framework of PGA makes it especially promising also to handle universal geometry, which extends rational trigonometry to the hyperbolic plane.", "field": "math", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Deep Learning Based Superposition Coded Modulation for Hierarchical Semantic Communications over Broadcast Channels\nAbstract: We consider multi-user semantic communications over broadcast channels. While most existing works consider that each receiver requires either the same or independent semantic information, this paper explores the scenario where the semantic information desired by different receivers is different but correlated. In particular, we investigate semantic communications over Gaussian broadcast channels where the transmitter has a common observable source but the receivers wish to recover hierarchical semantic information in adaptation to their channel conditions. Inspired by the capacity achieving property of superposition codes, we propose a deep learning based superposition coded modulation (DeepSCM) scheme. Specifically, the hierarchical semantic information is first extracted and encoded into basic and enhanced feature vectors. A linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) decorrelator is then developed to obtain a refinement from the enhanced features that is uncorrelated with the basic features. Finally, the basic features and their refinement are superposed for broadcasting after probabilistic modulation. Experiments are conducted for two-receiver image semantic broadcasting with coarse and fine classification as hierarchical semantic tasks. DeepSCM outperforms the benchmarking coded-modulation scheme without a superposition structure, especially with large channel disparity and high order modulation. It also approaches the performance upperbound as if there were only one receiver.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

On relaxed controls, two studied topologies are the Young and Borkar (weak$^*$) topologies on spaces of functions from a state/measurement space to the space of probability measures on control action spaces; the former via a weak convergence topology on probability measures on a product space with a fixed marginal on the input (state) space, and the latter via a weak$^*$ topology on randomized policies viewed as maps from states/measurements to the space of signed measures with bounded variation. We establish implication and equivalence conditions between the Young and Borkar topologies on control policies. We then show that, under some conditions, for a controlled Markov chain with standard Borel spaces the invariant measure is weakly continuous on the space of stationary control policies defined by either of these topologies. An implication is near optimality of quantized stationary policies in state and actions or continuous stationary and deterministic policies for average cost control under two sets of continuity conditions (with either weak continuity in the state-action pair or strong continuity in the action for each state) on transition kernels.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

In this study, we introduce a comprehensive probabilistic model of power distribution in beamspace, and formulate the joint optimization problem of probing beam selection and probabilistic beam prediction as an entropy minimization problem. Then, we propose a greedy scheme to iteratively and alternately solve this problem, where a transformer-based beam predictor is trained to estimate the conditional power distribution based on the probing beams and user location within each iteration, and the trained predictor selects an unmeasured beam that minimizes the entropy of remaining beams. To further reduce the number of interactions and the computational complexity of the iterative scheme, we propose a two-stage probing beam selection scheme. Firstly, probing beams are selected from a location-specific codebook designed by an entropy-based criterion, and predictions are made with corresponding feedback. Secondly, the optimal beam is identified using additional probing beams with the highest predicted power values. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes compared to hierarchical beam search and beam prediction with uniform probing beams.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Uncovering the Disentanglement Capability in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models\nAbstract: Generative models have been widely studied in computer vision. Recently, diffusion models have drawn substantial attention due to the high quality of their generated images. A key desired property of image generative models is the ability to disentangle different attributes, which should enable modification towards a style without changing the semantic content, and the modification parameters should generalize to different images. Previous studies have found that generative adversarial networks (GANs) are inherently endowed with such disentanglement capability, so they can perform disentangled image editing without re-training or fine-tuning the network. In this work, we explore whether diffusion models are also inherently equipped with such a capability. Our finding is that for stable diffusion models, by partially changing the input text embedding from a neutral description (e.g., \"a photo of person\") to one with style (e.g., \"a photo of person with smile\") while fixing all the Gaussian random noises introduced during the denoising process, the generated images can be modified towards the target style without changing the semantic content. Based on this finding, we further propose a simple, light-weight image editing algorithm where the mixing weights of the two text embeddings are optimized for style matching and content preservation. This entire process only involves optimizing over around 50 parameters and does not fine-tune the diffusion model itself. Experiments show that the proposed method can modify a wide range of attributes, with the performance outperforming diffusion-model-based image-editing algorithms that require fine-tuning. The optimized weights generalize well to different images. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/DiffusionDisentanglement.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Thermodynamic Consistent Neural Networks for Learning Material Interfacial Mechanics\nAbstract: For multilayer materials in thin substrate systems, interfacial failure is one of the most challenges. The traction-separation relations (TSR) quantitatively describe the mechanical behavior of a material interface undergoing openings, which is critical to understand and predict interfacial failures under complex loadings. However, existing theoretical models have limitations on enough complexity and flexibility to well learn the real-world TSR from experimental observations. A neural network can fit well along with the loading paths but often fails to obey the laws of physics, due to a lack of experimental data and understanding of the hidden physical mechanism. In this paper, we propose a thermodynamic consistent neural network (TCNN) approach to build a data-driven model of the TSR with sparse experimental data. The TCNN leverages recent advances in physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that encode prior physical information into the loss function and efficiently train the neural networks using automatic differentiation. We investigate three thermodynamic consistent principles, i.e., positive energy dissipation, steepest energy dissipation gradient, and energy conservative loading path. All of them are mathematically formulated and embedded into a neural network model with a novel defined loss function.

In this work, we introduce a novel learning-enabled perception-feedback hybrid controller, where we use Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) to show the safety and liveness of a full-stack perception-feedback controller. We use neural networks to learn a CBF and CLF for the full-stack system directly in the observation space of the robot, without the need to assume a separate perception-based state estimator. Our hybrid controller, called LOCUS (Learning-enabled Observation-feedback Control Using Switching), can safely navigate unknown environments, consistently reach its goal, and generalizes safely to environments outside of the training dataset. We demonstrate LOCUS in experiments both in simulation and in hardware, where it successfully navigates a changing environment using feedback from a Lidar sensor.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: GridFormer: Point-Grid Transformer for Surface Reconstruction\nAbstract: Implicit neural networks have emerged as a crucial technology in 3D surface reconstruction. To reconstruct continuous surfaces from discrete point clouds, encoding the input points into regular grid features (plane or volume) has been commonly employed in existing approaches. However, these methods typically use the grid as an index for uniformly scattering point features. Compared with the irregular point features, the regular grid features may sacrifice some reconstruction details but improve efficiency. To take full advantage of these two types of features, we introduce a novel and high-efficiency attention mechanism between the grid and point features named Point-Grid Transformer (GridFormer). This mechanism treats the grid as a transfer point connecting the space and point cloud. Our method maximizes the spatial expressiveness of grid features and maintains computational efficiency. Furthermore, optimizing predictions over the entire space could potentially result in blurred boundaries. To address this issue, we further propose a boundary optimization strategy incorporating margin binary cross-entropy loss and boundary sampling. This approach enables us to achieve a more precise representation of the object structure. Our experiments validate that our method is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches under widely used benchmarks by producing more precise geometry reconstructions.

{"text": "Title: Randomization can be as helpful as a glimpse of the future in online computation\nAbstract: We provide simple but surprisingly useful direct product theorems for proving lower bounds on online algorithms with a limited amount of advice about the future. As a consequence, we are able to translate decades of research on randomized online algorithms to the advice complexity model. Doing so improves significantly on the previous best advice complexity lower bounds for many online problems, or provides the first known lower bounds. For example, if $n$ is the number of requests, we show that: (1) A paging algorithm needs $\\Omega(n)$ bits of advice to achieve a competitive ratio better than $H_k=\\Omega(\\log k)$, where $k$ is the cache size. Previously, it was only known that $\\Omega(n)$ bits of advice were necessary to achieve a constant competitive ratio smaller than $5/4$. (2) Every $O(n^{1-\\varepsilon})$-competitive vertex coloring algorithm must use $\\Omega(n\\log n)$ bits of advice. Previously, it was only known that $\\Omega(n\\log n)$ bits of advice were necessary to be optimal. For certain online problems, including the MTS, $k$-server, paging, list update, and dynamic binary search tree problem, our results imply that randomization and sublinear advice are equally powerful (if the underlying metric space or node set is finite). This means that several long-standing open questions regarding randomized online algorithms can be equivalently stated as questions regarding online algorithms with sublinear advice. For example, we show that there exists a deterministic $O(\\log k)$-competitive $k$-server algorithm with advice complexity $o(n)$ if and only if there exists a randomized $O(\\log k)$-competitive $k$-server algorithm without advice.

{"text": "Title: Perspective Plane Program Induction from a Single Image\nAbstract: We study the inverse graphics problem of inferring a holistic representation for natural images. Given an input image, our goal is to induce a neuro-symbolic, program-like representation that jointly models camera poses, object locations, and global scene structures. Such high-level, holistic scene representations further facilitate low-level image manipulation tasks such as inpainting. We formulate this problem as jointly finding the camera pose and scene structure that best describe the input image. The benefits of such joint inference are two-fold: scene regularity serves as a new cue for perspective correction, and in turn, correct perspective correction leads to a simplified scene structure, similar to how the correct shape leads to the most regular texture in shape from texture. Our proposed framework, Perspective Plane Program Induction (P3I), combines search-based and gradient-based algorithms to efficiently solve the problem.

{"text": "Title: STAS: Spatial-Temporal Return Decomposition for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning\nAbstract: Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has been proven to be an effective paradigm in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). One of the major challenges is credit assignment, which aims to credit agents by their contributions. While prior studies have shown great success, their methods typically fail to work in episodic reinforcement learning scenarios where global rewards are revealed only at the end of the episode. They lack the functionality to model complicated relations of the delayed global reward in the temporal dimension and suffer from inefficiencies. To tackle this, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Attention with Shapley (STAS), a novel method that learns credit assignment in both temporal and spatial dimensions. It first decomposes the global return back to each time step, then utilizes the Shapley Value to redistribute the individual payoff from the decomposed global reward. To mitigate the computational complexity of the Shapley Value, we introduce an approximation of marginal contribution and utilize Monte Carlo sampling to estimate it. We evaluate our method on an Alice & Bob example and MPE environments across different scenarios. Our results demonstrate that our method effectively assigns spatial-temporal credit, outperforming all state-of-the-art baselines.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: Chordal graphs, even-hole-free graphs and sparse obstructions to bounded treewidth\nAbstract: We present and study the following conjecture: for an integer $t\\geq 4$ and a graph $H$, every even-hole-free graph of large enough treewidth has an induced subgraph isomorphic to either $K_t$ or $H$, if (and only if) $H$ is a $K_4$-free chordal graph. The ``only if'' part follows from the properties of the so-called layered wheels due to Sintiari and Trotignon. Alecu, Chudnovsky, Spirkl and the author recently proved the conjecture in two special cases: (a) when $t=4$; and (b) when $H=cone (F)$ for some forest $F$; that is, $H$ is obtained from $F$ by adding a universal vertex. Our first result is a common strengthening: for an integer $t\\geq 4$ and graphs $F$ and $H$, (even-hole, $cone(cone (F))$, $H$, $K_t$)-free graphs have bounded treewidth if and only if $F$ is a forest and $H$ is a $K_4$-free chordal graph. For general $t\\geq 4$, we push the current state of the art further than (b) by settling the conjecture for the smallest choices of $H$ that are not coned forests. This follows from our second result: we prove the conjecture when $H$ is a crystal; that is, a graph obtained from several coned double stars by gluing them together along the middle edges of the double stars. We also propose another conjecture motivated by the following observation: except for complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs, all the constructions of graphs with unbounded treewidth which have been discovered so far are $2$-degenerate. Specifically, we conjecture that for every $t\\geq 1$, every graph of sufficiently large treewidth has an induced subgraph of treewidth $t$ which is either complete, complete bipartite, or $2$-degenerate. This conjecture is the first to predict a grid-type theorem for induced subgraphs, and what makes it even more relevant is somewhat serendipitous: if true, it would imply our former conjecture by reducing it to (a).", "field": "math", "label": 0}

Given an $f$-fault-tolerant Euclidean $t$-spanner $G$ with $O(n)$ edges and a constant $\\varepsilon$, our data structure has size $O_{t,f}(n\\log n)$, and this allows us to compute an $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate distance in $G-F$ between $s$ and $s'$ can be computed in constant time for any two vertices $s$ and $s'$ and a set $F$ of $f$ failed vertices. Also, with a data structure of size $O_{t,f}(n\\log n\\log\\log n)$, we can compute an $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate shortest path in $G-F$ between $s$ and $s'$ in $O_{t,f}(\\log^2 n\\log\\log n+\\textsf{sol})$ time for any two vertices $s$ and $s'$ and a set $F$ of failed vertices, where $\\textsf{sol}$ denotes the number of vertices in the returned path.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: KCES: A Workflow Containerization Scheduling Scheme Under Cloud-Edge Collaboration Framework\nAbstract: As more IoT applications gradually move towards the cloud-edge collaborative mode, the containerized scheduling of workflows extends from the cloud to the edge. However, given the high delay of the communication network, loose coupling of structure, and resource heterogeneity between cloud and edge, workflow containerization scheduling in the cloud-edge scenarios faces the difficulty of resource coordination and application collaboration management. To address these two issues, we propose a KubeEdge-Cloud-Edge-Scheduling scheme named KCES, a workflow containerization scheduling scheme for the KubeEdge cloud-edge framework. The KCES includes a cloud-edge workflow scheduling engine for KubeEdge and workflow scheduling strategies for task horizontal roaming and vertical offloading. Considering the scheduling optimization of cloud-edge workflows, this paper proposes a cloud-edge workflow scheduling model and cloud-edge node model and designs a cloud-edge workflow scheduling engine to maximize cloud-edge resource utilization under the constraint of workflow task delay. A cloud-edge resource hybrid management technology is used to design the cloud-edge resource evaluation and resource allocation algorithms to achieve cloud-edge resource collaboration. Based on the ideas of distributed functional roles and the hierarchical division of computing power, the horizontal roaming among the edges and vertical offloading strategies between the cloud and edges for workflow tasks are designed to realize the cloud-edge application collaboration. Through a customized IoT application workflow instance, experimental results show that KCES is superior to the baseline in total workflow duration, average workflow duration, and resource usage and has the capabilities of horizontal roaming and vertical offloading for workflow tasks.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: A new combinatorial approach for edge universality of Wigner matrices\nAbstract: In this paper we introduce a new combinatorial approach to analyze the trace of large powers of Wigner matrices. Our approach is motivated from the paper by \\citet{sosh}. However the counting approach is different. We start with classical word sentence approach similar to \\citet{AZ05} and take the motivation from \\citet{sinaisosh}, \\citet{sosh} and \\citet{peche2009universality} to encode the words to objects similar to Dyck paths. To be precise the map takes a word to a Dyck path with some edges removed from it. Using this new counting we prove edge universality for large Wigner matrices with sub-Gaussian entries. One novelty of this approach is unlike \\citet{sinaisosh}, \\citet{sosh} and \\citet{peche2009universality} we do not need to assume the entries of the matrices are symmetrically distributed around $0$. The main technical contribution of this paper is two folded. Firstly we produce an encoding of the ``contributing words\" (for definition one might look at Section \\ref{sec:word}) of the Wigner matrix which retrieves the edge universality. Hence this is the best one can do. We hope this method will be applicable to many other scenarios in random matrices. Secondly in course of the paper we give a combinatorial description of the GOE Tracy Widom law. The explanation for GUE is very similar. This explanation might be important for the models where exact calculations are not available but some combinatorial structures are present.", "field": "math", "label": 1}

This is in analogy to the reciprocity obstructions recently used to disprove the Apollonian local-global conjecture. We give an example of such an orbit which is known exactly, and misses all squares together with an explicit finite list of sporadic values: the corresponding semigroup is not thin, but its Zariski closure does not miss squares. We also demonstrate thin semigroups with reciprocity obstructions, including semigroups associated to continued fractions formed from finite alphabets. Zaremba's conjecture states that for continued fractions with coefficients chosen from $\\{1,\\ldots,5\\}$, every positive integer appears as a denominator. Bourgain and Kontorovich proposed a generalization of Zaremba's conjecture in the context of semigroups associated to finite alphabets. We disprove their conjecture.

{"text": "Title: Decentralized Multi-Task Online Convex Optimization Under Random Link Failures\nAbstract: Decentralized optimization methods often entail information exchange between neighbors. Transmission failures can happen due to network congestion, hardware/software issues, communication outage, and other factors. In this paper, we investigate the random link failure problem in decentralized multi-task online convex optimization, where agents have individual decisions that are coupled with each other via pairwise constraints. Although widely used in constrained optimization, conventional saddle-point algorithms are not directly applicable here because of random packet dropping. To address this issue, we develop a robust decentralized saddle-point algorithm against random link failures with heterogeneous probabilities by replacing the missing decisions of neighbors with their latest received values. Then, by judiciously bounding the accumulated deviation stemming from this replacement, we first establish that our algorithm achieves $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret and $\\mathcal{O}(T^\\frac{3}{4})$ constraint violations for the full information scenario, where the complete information on the local cost function is revealed to each agent at the end of each time slot. These two bounds match, in order sense, the performance bounds of algorithms with perfect communications. Further, we extend our algorithm and analysis to the two-point bandit feedback scenario, where only the values of the local cost function at two random points are disclosed to each agent sequentially. Performance bounds of the same orders as the full information case are derived.

The ideal element functions as a vote, where each voter prefers elements that are closer to her ideal element. But it also functions as a proposal, thus making all participants equal not only as voters but also as proposers. We consider Condorcet aggregation and a continuum of solution concepts, ranging from minimizing the sum of distances to minimizing the maximum distance. We study applications of the abstract model to various social choice settings, including single-winner elections, committee elections, participatory budgeting, and participatory legislation.

{"text": "Title: Inequity aversion improves cooperation in intertemporal social dilemmas\nAbstract: Groups of humans are often able to find ways to cooperate with one another in complex, temporally extended social dilemmas. Models based on behavioral economics are only able to explain this phenomenon for unrealistic stateless matrix games. Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning has been applied to generalize social dilemma problems to temporally and spatially extended Markov games. However, this has not yet generated an agent that learns to cooperate in social dilemmas as humans do. A key insight is that many, but not all, human individuals have inequity averse social preferences. This promotes a particular resolution of the matrix game social dilemma wherein inequity-averse individuals are personally pro-social and punish defectors. Here we extend this idea to Markov games and show that it promotes cooperation in several types of sequential social dilemma, via a profitable interaction with policy learnability. In particular, we find that inequity aversion improves temporal credit assignment for the important class of intertemporal social dilemmas. These results help explain how large-scale cooperation may emerge and persist.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Investigation of the Sense of Agency in Social Cognition, based on frameworks of Predictive Coding and Active Inference: A simulation study on multimodal imitative interaction\nAbstract: When agents interact socially with different intentions, conflicts are difficult to avoid. Although how agents can resolve such problems autonomously has not been determined, dynamic characteristics of agency may shed light on underlying mechanisms. The current study focused on the sense of agency (SoA), a specific aspect of agency referring to congruence between the agent's intention in acting and the outcome. Employing predictive coding and active inference as theoretical frameworks of perception and action generation, we hypothesize that regulation of complexity in the evidence lower bound of an agent's model should affect the strength of the agent's SoA and should have a critical impact on social interactions. We built a computational model of imitative interaction between a robot and a human via visuo-proprioceptive sensation with a variational Bayes recurrent neural network, and simulated the model in the form of pseudo-imitative interaction using recorded human body movement data. A key feature of the model is that each modality's complexity can be regulated differently with a hyperparameter assigned to each module. We first searched for an optimal setting that endows the model with appropriate coordination of multimodal sensation. This revealed that the vision module's complexity should be more tightly regulated than that of the proprioception module. Using the optimally trained model, we examined how changing the tightness of complexity regulation after training affects the strength of the SoA during interactions. The results showed that with looser regulation, an agent tends to act more egocentrically, without adapting to the other. In contrast, with tighter regulation, the agent tends to follow the other by adjusting its intention. We conclude that the tightness of complexity regulation crucially affects the strength of the SoA and the dynamics of interactions between agents.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: DeepOnet Based Preconditioning Strategies For Solving Parametric Linear Systems of Equations\nAbstract: We introduce a new class of hybrid preconditioners for solving parametric linear systems of equations. The proposed preconditioners are constructed by hybridizing the deep operator network, namely DeepONet, with standard iterative methods. Exploiting the spectral bias, DeepONet-based components are harnessed to address low-frequency error components, while conventional iterative methods are employed to mitigate high-frequency error components. Our preconditioning framework comprises two distinct hybridization approaches: direct preconditioning (DP) and trunk basis (TB) approaches. In the DP approach, DeepONet is used to approximate an action of an inverse operator to a vector during each preconditioning step.

{"text": "Title: Optimal cross-learning for contextual bandits with unknown context distributions\nAbstract: We consider the problem of designing contextual bandit algorithms in the ``cross-learning'' setting of Balseiro et al., where the learner observes the loss for the action they play in all possible contexts, not just the context of the current round. We specifically consider the setting where losses are chosen adversarially and contexts are sampled i.i.d. from an unknown distribution. In this setting, we resolve an open problem of Balseiro et al. by providing an efficient algorithm with a nearly tight (up to logarithmic factors) regret bound of $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{TK})$, independent of the number of contexts. As a consequence, we obtain the first nearly tight regret bounds for the problems of learning to bid in first-price auctions (under unknown value distributions) and sleeping bandits with a stochastic action set. At the core of our algorithm is a novel technique for coordinating the execution of a learning algorithm over multiple epochs in such a way to remove correlations between estimation of the unknown distribution and the actions played by the algorithm. This technique may be of independent interest for other learning problems involving estimation of an unknown context distribution.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Evaluating Language-Model Agents on Realistic Autonomous Tasks\nAbstract: In this report, we explore the ability of language model agents to acquire resources, create copies of themselves, and adapt to novel challenges they encounter in the wild. We refer to this cluster of capabilities as \"autonomous replication and adaptation\" or ARA. We believe that systems capable of ARA could have wide-reaching and hard-to-anticipate consequences, and that measuring and forecasting ARA may be useful for informing measures around security, monitoring, and alignment. Additionally, once a system is capable of ARA, placing bounds on a system's capabilities may become significantly more difficult. We construct four simple example agents that combine language models with tools that allow them to take actions in the world. We then evaluate these agents on 12 tasks relevant to ARA. We find that these language model agents can only complete the easiest tasks from this list, although they make some progress on the more challenging tasks. Unfortunately, these evaluations are not adequate to rule out the possibility that near-future agents will be capable of ARA. In particular, we do not think that these evaluations provide good assurance that the ``next generation'' of language models (e.g. 100x effective compute scaleup on existing models) will not yield agents capable of ARA, unless intermediate evaluations are performed during pretraining. Relatedly, we expect that fine-tuning of the existing models could produce substantially more competent agents, even if the fine-tuning is not directly targeted at ARA.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: New Perspective on Progressive GANs Distillation for One-class Novelty Detection\nAbstract: One-class novelty detection is conducted to identify anomalous instances, with different distributions from the expected normal instances. In this paper, the Generative Adversarial Network based on the Encoder-Decoder-Encoder scheme (EDE-GAN) achieves state-of-the-art performance. The two factors bellow serve the above purpose: 1) The EDE-GAN calculates the distance between two latent vectors as the anomaly score, which is unlike the previous methods by utilizing the reconstruction error between images. 2) The model obtains best results when the batch size is set to 1. To illustrate their superiority, we design a new GAN architecture, and compare performances according to different batch sizes. Moreover, with experimentation leads to discovery, our result implies there is also evidence of just how beneficial constraint on the latent space are when engaging in model training. In an attempt to learn compact and fast models, we present a new technology, Progressive Knowledge Distillation with GANs (P-KDGAN), which connects two standard GANs through the designed distillation loss. Two-step progressive learning continuously augments the performance of student GANs with improved results over single-step approach. Our experimental results on CIFAR-10, MNIST, and FMNIST datasets illustrate that P-KDGAN improves the performance of the student GAN by 2.44%, 1.77%, and 1.73% when compressing the computationat ratios of 24.45:1, 311.11:1, and 700:1, respectively.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Representing General Stochastic Processes as Martingale Laws\nAbstract: Random variables $X^i$, $i=1,2$ are 'probabilistically equivalent' if they have the same law. Moreover, in any class of equivalent random variables it is easy to select canonical representatives. The corresponding questions are more involved for processes $X^i$ on filtered stochastic bases $(\\Omega^i, \\mathcal F^i, \\mathbb P^i, (\\mathcal F^i_t)_{t\\in [0,1]})$. Here equivalence in law does not capture relevant properties of processes such as the solutions to stochastic control or multistage decision problems. This motivates Aldous to introduce the stronger notion of synonymity based on prediction processes. Stronger still, Hoover--Keisler formalize what it means that $X^i$, $i=1,2$ have the same probabilistic properties. We establish that canonical representatives of the Hoover--Keisler equivalence classes are given precisely by the set of all Markov-martingale laws on a specific nested path space $\\mathsf M_\\infty$. As a consequence we obtain that, modulo Hoover--Keisler equivalence, the class of stochastic processes forms a Polish space. On this space, processes are topologically close iff they model similar probabilistic phenomena. In particular this means that their laws as well as the information encoded in the respective filtrations are similar. Importantly, compact sets of processes admit a Prohorov-type characterization. We also obtain that for every stochastic process, defined on some abstract basis, there exists a process with identical probabilistic properties which is defined on a standard Borel space.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

The ideals $I_h$ generalize algebraically a family of ideals called the Tanisaki ideal, which is used in a geometric construction of permutation representations called Springer theory. To define $I_h$, we use polynomials in a proper subset of the variables ${x_1,...,x_n}$ that are symmetric under the corresponding permutation subgroup.

The problem is posed on the unit square. The second derivative is multiplied by a singular perturbation parameter, $\\epsilon$, while the nature of the first derivative term is such that flow is aligned with a boundary.

However, in most cases, they are not eigenfunctions of some singular Sturm-Liouville problem, as is the case for classical polynomials. Therefore, standard results regarding convergence cannot be applied.

In this work, we determine the convergence rate using a comparison Lemma. We also present a spectrally convergent, multidimensional, integration method. Numerical examples demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. We show that the use of nonstandard weight functions can allow for efficient integration of singular functions.

In general these measurements are collected manually using basic equipment; usually a compass/clinometer and a backboard, recorded on a map by hand. Various computing techniques and technologies, such as Lidar, have been utilised in order to automate this process and update the collection paradigm for these types of measurements. Techniques such as Structure from Motion (SfM) reconstruct of scenes and objects by generating a point cloud from input images, with detailed reconstruction possible on the decimetre scale. SfM-type techniques provide advantages in areas of cost and usability in more varied environmental conditions, while sacrificing the extreme levels of data fidelity. Here is presented a methodology of data acquisition and a Machine Learning-based software system: GeoStructure, developed to automate the measurement of orientation measurements. Rather than deriving measurements using a method applied to the input images, such as the Hough Transform, this method takes measurements directly from the reconstructed point cloud surfaces. Point cloud noise is mitigated using a Mahalanobis distance implementation.

In this paper we show that for {\\it all} fixed odd distances, there exist near-optimal CWCs and CCCs asymptotically achieving the classic Johnson-type upper bounds. Let $A_q(n,w,d)$ denote the maximum size of $q$-ary CWCs of length $n$ with constant weight $w$ and minimum distance $d$.

In this paper, we went a step further to identify true friends for making even more realistic recommendations. we calculated the similarity between users, as well as the dependency between a user and an item. Our hypothesis is that due to the uncertainties in user preferences, the fuzzy clustering, instead of the classical hard clustering, is beneficial in accurate recommendations. We incorporated the C-means algorithm to get different membership degrees of soft users' clusters. Then, the users' similarity metric is defined according to the soft clusters. Later, in a training scheme we determined the latent representations of users and items, extracting from the huge and sparse user-item-tag matrix using matrix factorization. In the parameter tuning, we found the optimum coefficients for the influence of our soft social regularization and the user-item dependency terms.

We develop two novel algorithms, where each agent only plays from a subset of all the arms. Agents use the communication medium to recommend only arm-IDs (not samples), and thus update the set of arms from which they play. We establish that, if agents communicate $\\Omega(\\log(T))$ times through any connected pairwise gossip mechanism, then every agent's regret is a factor of order $N$ smaller compared to the case of no collaborations. Furthermore, we show that the communication constraints only have a second order effect on the regret of our algorithm. We then analyze this second order term of the regret to derive bounds on the regret-communication tradeoffs. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithm and conclude that the insights are fundamental and not artifacts of our bounds. We also show a lower bound which gives that the regret scaling obtained by our algorithm cannot be improved even in the absence of any communication constraints. Our results thus demonstrate that even a minimal level of collaboration among agents greatly reduces regret for all agents.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Learning Multi-Step Manipulation Tasks from A Single Human Demonstration\nAbstract: Learning from human demonstrations has exhibited remarkable achievements in robot manipulation. However, the challenge remains to develop a robot system that matches human capabilities and data efficiency in learning and generalizability, particularly in complex, unstructured real-world scenarios. We propose a system that processes RGBD videos to translate human actions to robot primitives and identifies task-relevant key poses of objects using Grounded Segment Anything. We then address challenges for robots in replicating human actions, considering the human-robot differences in kinematics and collision geometry. To test the effectiveness of our system, we conducted experiments focusing on manual dishwashing. With a single human demonstration recorded in a mockup kitchen, the system achieved 50-100% success for each step and up to a 40% success rate for the whole task with different objects in a home kitchen.

{"text": "Title: Revisiting Norm Estimation in Data Streams\nAbstract: The problem of estimating the pth moment F_p (p nonnegative and real) in data streams is as follows. There is a vector x which starts at 0, and many updates of the form x_i <-- x_i + v come sequentially in a stream. The algorithm also receives an error parameter 0 < eps < 1. The goal is then to output an approximation with relative error at most eps to F_p = ||x||_p^p. Previously, it was known that polylogarithmic space (in the vector length n) was achievable if and only if p <= 2. We make several new contributions in this regime, including: (*) An optimal space algorithm for 0 < p < 2, which, unlike previous algorithms which had optimal dependence on 1/eps but sub-optimal dependence on n, does not rely on a generic pseudorandom generator. (*) A near-optimal space algorithm for p = 0 with optimal update and query time. (*) A near-optimal space algorithm for the \"distinct elements\" problem (p = 0 and all updates have v = 1) with optimal update and query time. (*) Improved L_2 --> L_2 dimensionality reduction in a stream. (*) New 1-pass lower bounds to show optimality and near-optimality of our algorithms, as well as of some previous algorithms (the \"AMS sketch\" for p = 2, and the L_1-difference algorithm of Feigenbaum et al.). As corollaries of our work, we also obtain a few separations in the complexity of moment estimation problems: F_0 in 1 pass vs. 2 passes, p = 0 vs. p > 0, and F_0 with strictly positive updates vs. arbitrary updates.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

Here, we extend this model to $L_p$-spherically symmetric subspaces. In order to model local amplitude and phase structure in images, we focus on the case of two dimensional subspaces, and the $L_2$-norm. When trained on natural images the model learns subspaces resembling quadrature-pair Gabor filters. We then introduce an additional set of hidden units that model the dependencies among subspace phases.

{"text": "Title: Fourier neural operator based fluid-structure interaction for predicting the vesicle dynamics\nAbstract: Solving complex fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems, characterized by nonlinear partial differential equations, is crucial in various scientific and engineering applications. Traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers are insufficient to meet the growing requirements for large-scale and long-period simulations. Fortunately, the rapid advancement in neural networks, especially neural operator learning mappings between function spaces, has introduced novel approaches to tackle these challenges via data-driven modeling. In this paper, we propose a Fourier neural operator-based fluid-structure interaction solver (FNO-based FSI solver) for efficient simulation of FSI problems, where the solid solver based on the finite difference method is seamlessly integrated with the Fourier neural operator to predict incompressible flow using the immersed boundary method. We analyze the performance of the FNO-based FSI solver in the following three situations: training data with or without the steady state, training method with one-step label or multi-step labels, and prediction in interpolation or extrapolation. We find that the best performance for interpolation is achieved by training the operator with multi-step labels using steady-state data. Finally, we train the FNO-based FSI solver using this optimal training method and apply it to vesicle dynamics. The results show that the FNO-based FSI solver is capable of capturing the variations in the fluid and the vesicle.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: A Pragmatic Look at Deep Imitation Learning\nAbstract: The introduction of the generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL) algorithm has spurred the development of scalable imitation learning approaches using deep neural networks. Many of the algorithms that followed used a similar procedure, combining on-policy actor-critic algorithms with inverse reinforcement learning. More recently there have been an even larger breadth of approaches, most of which use off-policy algorithms. However, with the breadth of algorithms, everything from datasets to base reinforcement learning algorithms to evaluation settings can vary, making it difficult to fairly compare them. In this work we re-implement 6 different IL algorithms, updating 3 of them to be off-policy, base them on a common off-policy algorithm (SAC), and evaluate them on a widely-used expert trajectory dataset (D4RL) for the most common benchmark (MuJoCo). After giving all algorithms the same hyperparameter optimisation budget, we compare their results for a range of expert trajectories. In summary, GAIL, with all of its improvements, consistently performs well across a range of sample sizes, AdRIL is a simple contender that performs well with one important hyperparameter to tune, and behavioural cloning remains a strong baseline when data is more plentiful.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Adversarial Machine Learning-Enabled Anonymization of OpenWiFi Data\nAbstract: Data privacy and protection through anonymization is a critical issue for network operators or data owners before it is forwarded for other possible use of data. With the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI), data anonymization augments the likelihood of covering up necessary sensitive information; preventing data leakage and information loss. OpenWiFi networks are vulnerable to any adversary who is trying to gain access or knowledge on traffic regardless of the knowledge possessed by data owners. The odds for discovery of actual traffic information is addressed by applied conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN). CTGAN yields synthetic data; which disguises as actual data but fostering hidden acute information of actual data. In this paper, the similarity assessment of synthetic with actual data is showcased in terms of clustering algorithms followed by a comparison of performance for unsupervised cluster validation metrics. A well-known algorithm, K-means outperforms other algorithms in terms of similarity assessment of synthetic data over real data while achieving nearest scores 0.634, 23714.57, and 0.598 as Silhouette, Calinski and Harabasz and Davies Bouldin metric respectively. On exploiting a comparative analysis in validation scores among several algorithms, K-means forms the epitome of unsupervised clustering algorithms ensuring explicit usage of synthetic data at the same time a replacement for real data.

{"text": "Title: A scalable computational platform for particulate Stokes suspensions\nAbstract: We describe a computational framework for simulating suspensions of rigid particles in Newtonian Stokes flow. One central building block is a collision-resolution algorithm that overcomes the numerical constraints arising from particle collisions. This algorithm extends the well-known complementarity method for non-smooth multi-body dynamics to resolve collisions in dense rigid body suspensions. This approach formulates the collision resolution problem as a linear complementarity problem with geometric `non-overlapping' constraints imposed at each timestep. It is then reformulated as a constrained quadratic programming problem and the Barzilai-Borwein projected gradient descent method is applied for its solution. This framework is designed to be applicable for any convex particle shape, e.g., spheres and spherocylinders, and applicable to any Stokes mobility solver, including the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa approximation, Stokesian Dynamics, and PDE solvers (e.g., boundary integral and immersed boundary methods). In particular, this method imposes Newton's Third Law and records the entire contact network.

First, most existing PINNs are based on point-wise formulation with fully-connected networks to learn continuous functions, which suffer from poor scalability and hard boundary enforcement. Second, the infinite search space over-complicates the non-convex optimization for network training. Third, although the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based discrete learning can significantly improve training efficiency, CNNs struggle to handle irregular geometries with unstructured meshes. To properly address these challenges, we present a novel discrete PINN framework based on graph convolutional network (GCN) and variational structure of PDE to solve forward and inverse partial differential equations (PDEs) in a unified manner. The use of a piecewise polynomial basis can reduce the dimension of search space and facilitate training and convergence. Without the need of tuning penalty parameters in classic PINNs, the proposed method can strictly impose boundary conditions and assimilate sparse data in both forward and inverse settings.

{"text": "Title: DCR-Consistency: Divide-Conquer-Reasoning for Consistency Evaluation and Improvement of Large Language Models\nAbstract: Evaluating the quality and variability of text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a significant, yet unresolved research challenge. Traditional evaluation methods, such as ROUGE and BERTScore, which measure token similarity, often fail to capture the holistic semantic equivalence. This results in a low correlation with human judgments and intuition, which is especially problematic in high-stakes applications like healthcare and finance where reliability, safety, and robust decision-making are highly critical. This work proposes DCR, an automated framework for evaluating and improving the consistency of LLM-generated texts using a divide-conquer-reasoning approach. Unlike existing LLM-based evaluators that operate at the paragraph level, our method employs a divide-and-conquer evaluator (DCE) that breaks down the paragraph-to-paragraph comparison between two generated responses into individual sentence-to-paragraph comparisons, each evaluated based on predefined criteria. To facilitate this approach, we introduce an automatic metric converter (AMC) that translates the output from DCE into an interpretable numeric score. Beyond the consistency evaluation, we further present a reason-assisted improver (RAI) that leverages the analytical reasons with explanations identified by DCE to generate new responses aimed at reducing these inconsistencies. Through comprehensive and systematic empirical analysis, we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +19.3% and +24.3% on the SummEval dataset) in evaluating the consistency of LLM generation across multiple benchmarks in semantic, factual, and summarization consistency tasks.

{"text": "Title: An Improved Algorithm for Computing All the Best Swap Edges of a Tree Spanner\nAbstract: A tree $\\sigma$-spanner of a positively real-weighted $n$-vertex and $m$-edge undirected graph $G$ is a spanning tree $T$ of $G$ which approximately preserves (i.e., up to a multiplicative stretch factor $\\sigma$) distances in $G$. Tree spanners with provably good stretch factors find applications in communication networks, distributed systems, and network design. However, finding an optimal or even a good tree spanner is a very hard computational task. Thus, if one has to face a transient edge failure in $T$, the overall effort that has to be afforded to rebuild a new tree spanner (i.e., computational costs, set-up of new links, updating of the routing tables, etc.) can be rather prohibitive. To circumvent this drawback, an effective alternative is that of associating with each tree edge a best possible (in terms of resulting stretch) swap edge -- a well-established approach in the literature for several other tree topologies. Correspondingly, the problem of computing all the best swap edges of a tree spanner is a challenging algorithmic problem, since solving it efficiently means to exploit the structure of shortest paths not only in $G$, but also in all the scenarios in which an edge of $T$ has failed. For this problem we provide a very efficient solution, running in $O(n^2 \\log^4 n)$ time, which drastically improves (almost by a quadratic factor in $n$ in dense graphs!) on the previous known best result.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Force-Based Atomistic/Continuum Blending for Multilattices\nAbstract: We formulate the blended force-based quasicontinuum (BQCF) method for multilattices and develop rigorous error estimates in terms of the approximation parameters: atomistic region, blending region and continuum finite element mesh. Balancing the approximation parameters yields a convergent atomistic/continuum multiscale method for multilattices with point defects, including a rigorous convergence rate in terms of the computational cost. The analysis is illustrated with numerical results for a Stone--Wales defect in graphene.", "field": "math", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Adaptive Population-based Simulated Annealing for Uncertain Resource Constrained Job Scheduling\nAbstract: Transporting ore from mines to ports is of significant interest in mining supply chains. These operations are commonly associated with growing costs and a lack of resources. Large mining companies are interested in optimally allocating their resources to reduce operational costs. This problem has been previously investigated in the literature as resource constrained job scheduling (RCJS). While a number of optimisation methods have been proposed to tackle the deterministic problem, the uncertainty associated with resource availability, an inevitable challenge in mining operations, has received less attention. RCJS with uncertainty is a hard combinatorial optimisation problem that cannot be solved efficiently with existing optimisation methods. This study proposes an adaptive population-based simulated annealing algorithm that can overcome the limitations of existing methods for RCJS with uncertainty including the premature convergence, the excessive number of hyper-parameters, and the inefficiency in coping with different uncertainty levels. This new algorithm is designed to effectively balance exploration and exploitation, by using a population, modifying the cooling schedule in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, and using an adaptive mechanism to select perturbation operators. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods across a wide range of benchmark RCJS instances and uncertainty levels. Moreover, new best known solutions are discovered for all but one problem instance across all uncertainty levels.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Improved estimators in Bell regression model with application\nAbstract: In this paper, we propose the application of shrinkage strategies to estimate coefficients in the Bell regression models when prior information about the coefficients is available. The Bell regression models are well-suited for modeling count data with multiple covariates. Furthermore, we provide a detailed explanation of the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators, including asymptotic biases and mean squared errors. To assess the performance of the estimators, we conduct numerical studies using Monte Carlo simulations and evaluate their simulated relative efficiency. The results demonstrate that the suggested estimators outperform the unrestricted estimator when prior information is taken into account. Additionally, we present an empirical application to demonstrate the practical utility of the suggested estimators.", "field": "math", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: An algorithm for estimating the crossing number of dense graphs, and continuous analogs of the crossing and rectilinear crossing numbers\nAbstract: We present a deterministic $n^{2+o(1)}$-time algorithm that approximates the crossing number of any graph $G$ of order $n$ up to an additive error of $o(n^4)$. We also provide a randomized polynomial-time algorithm that constructs a drawing of $G$ with $\\text{cr}(G)+o(n^4)$ crossings. These results are made interesting by the well known fact that every dense $n$-vertex graph has crossing number $\\Theta(n^4)$. Our work builds on a technique developed by Fox, Pach and S\\'uk, who obtained very similar results for the rectilinear crossing number. The results by the aforementioned authors and in this paper imply that the (normalized) crossing and rectilinear crossing numbers are estimable parameters. Motivated by this, we introduce two graphon parameters, the \\textit{crossing density} and the \\textit{rectilinear crossing density}, and then we prove that, in a precise sense, these are the correct continuous analogs of the crossing and rectilinear crossing numbers of graphs.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: The Solvability of Interpretability Evaluation Metrics\nAbstract: Feature attribution methods are popular for explaining neural network predictions, and they are often evaluated on metrics such as comprehensiveness and sufficiency. In this paper, we highlight an intriguing property of these metrics: their solvability. Concretely, we can define the problem of optimizing an explanation for a metric, which can be solved by beam search. This observation leads to the obvious yet unaddressed question: why do we use explainers (e.g., LIME) not based on solving the target metric, if the metric value represents explanation quality? We present a series of investigations showing strong performance of this beam search explainer and discuss its broader implication: a definition-evaluation duality of interpretability concepts. We implement the explainer and release the Python solvex package for models of text, image and tabular domains.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Hadwiger's conjecture and topological bounds\nAbstract: The Odd Hadwiger's conjecture, formulated by Gerards and Seymour in 1995, is a substantial strengthening of Hadwiger's famous coloring conjecture from 1943. We investigate whether the hierarchy of topological lower bounds on the chromatic number, introduced by Matou\\v{s}ek and Ziegler (2003) and refined recently by Daneshpajouh and Meunier (2023), forms a potential avenue to a disproof of Hadwiger's conjecture or its odd-minor variant. In this direction, we prove that, in a very general sense, every graph $G$ that admits a topological lower bound of $t$ on its chromatic number, contains $K_{\\lfloor t/2\\rfloor +1}$ as an odd-minor. This solves a problem posed by Simonyi and Zsb\\'{a}n [European Journal of Combinatorics, 31(8), 2110--2119 (2010)]. We also prove that if for a graph $G$ the Dol'nikov-K\\v{r}\\'{i}\\v{z} lower bound on the chromatic number (one of the lower bounds in the aforementioned hierarchy) attains a value of at least $t$, then $G$ contains $K_t$ as a minor. Finally, extending results by Simonyi and Zsb\\'{a}n, we show that the Odd Hadwiger's conjecture holds for Schrijver and Kneser graphs for any choice of the parameters. The latter are canonical examples of graphs for which topological lower bounds on the chromatic number are tight.", "field": "math", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: Joint distribution in residue classes of families of polynomially-defined multiplicative functions\nAbstract: We study the distribution of families of multiplicative functions among the coprime residue classes to moduli varying uniformly in a wide range, when the multiplicative functions can be controlled by the values of polynomials at the first few prime powers. We obtain complete uniform extensions of a criterion of Narkiewicz for families of such multiplicative functions, thus also generalizing and improving upon previous work for a single such function and establishing results that are optimal in most parameters and hypotheses. As a special case of our results, for any fixed $\\epsilon>0$, the Euler totient function $\\phi(n)$ and sum of divisors function $\\sigma(n)$ are jointly asymptotically equidistributed among the reduced residue classes to moduli $q$ coprime to $6$ varying uniformly up to $(\\log x)^{(1-\\epsilon)\\alpha(q)}$, where $\\alpha(q) = \\prod_{\\ell \\mid q} (\\ell-3)/(\\ell-1)$; furthermore, the coprimality restriction is necessary and the range of $q$ is essentially optimal.", "field": "math", "label": 0}
{"text": "Title: The extension problem in free harmonic analysis\nAbstract: This paper studies certain aspects of harmonic analysis on nonabelian free groups. We focus on the concept of a positive definite function on the free group and our primary goal is to understand how such functions can be extended from balls of finite radius to the entire group. Previous work showed that such extensions always exist and we study the problem of simultaneous extension of multiple positive definite functions. More specifically, we define a concept of 'relative energy' which measures the proximity between a pair of positive definite functions, and show that a pair of positive definite functions on a finite ball can be extended to the entire group without increasing their relative energy. The proof is analytic, involving differentiation of noncommutative Szego parameters.", "field": "math", "label": 1}
