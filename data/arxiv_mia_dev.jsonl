In the policy optimization setting, two timescale nonlinear SA can also model the greedy gradient-Q (Greedy-GQ) algorithm.

{"text": "Title: Predicting parametric spatiotemporal dynamics by multi-resolution PDE structure-preserved deep learning\nAbstract: Pure data-driven deep learning models suffer from high training costs, error accumulation, and poor generalizability when predicting complex physical processes. A more promising way is to leverage our prior physics knowledge in scientific deep learning models, known as physics-informed deep learning (PiDL). In most PiDL frameworks, the physics prior is utilized to regularize neural network training by incorporating governing equations into the loss function. The resulting physical constraint, imposed in a soft manner, relies heavily on a proper setting of hyperparameters that weigh each loss term. To this end, we propose a new direction to leverage physics prior knowledge by ``baking'' the mathematical structure of governing equations into the neural network architecture, namely PDE-preserved neural network (PPNN). The discretized PDE is preserved in PPNN as convolutional residual networks formulated in a multi-resolution setting. This physics-inspired learning architecture endows PPNN with excellent generalizability and long-term prediction accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art black-box baselines.

{"text": "Title: Estimating Categorical Counterfactuals via Deep Twin Networks\nAbstract: Counterfactual inference is a powerful tool, capable of solving challenging problems in high-profile sectors. To perform counterfactual inference, one requires knowledge of the underlying causal mechanisms. However, causal mechanisms cannot be uniquely determined from observations and interventions alone. This raises the question of how to choose the causal mechanisms so that resulting counterfactual inference is trustworthy in a given domain. This question has been addressed in causal models with binary variables, but the case of categorical variables remains unanswered. We address this challenge by introducing for causal models with categorical variables the notion of counterfactual ordering, a principle that posits desirable properties causal mechanisms should posses, and prove that it is equivalent to specific functional constraints on the causal mechanisms. To learn causal mechanisms satisfying these constraints, and perform counterfactual inference with them, we introduce deep twin networks. These are deep neural networks that, when trained, are capable of twin network counterfactual inference -- an alternative to the abduction, action, & prediction method. We empirically test our approach on diverse real-world and semi-synthetic data from medicine, epidemiology, and finance, reporting accurate estimation of counterfactual probabilities while demonstrating the issues that arise with counterfactual reasoning when counterfactual ordering is not enforced.", "label": 1, "field": "cs"}

{"text": "Title: Category-Level 6D Object Pose Estimation with Flexible Vector-Based Rotation Representation\nAbstract: In this paper, we propose a novel 3D graph convolution based pipeline for category-level 6D pose and size estimation from monocular RGB-D images. The proposed method leverages an efficient 3D data augmentation and a novel vector-based decoupled rotation representation. Specifically, we first design an orientation-aware autoencoder with 3D graph convolution for latent feature learning. The learned latent feature is insensitive to point shift and size thanks to the shift and scale-invariance properties of the 3D graph convolution. Then, to efficiently decode the rotation information from the latent feature, we design a novel flexible vector-based decomposable rotation representation that employs two decoders to complementarily access the rotation information. The proposed rotation representation has two major advantages: 1) decoupled characteristic that makes the rotation estimation easier; 2) flexible length and rotated angle of the vectors allow us to find a more suitable vector representation for specific pose estimation task. Finally, we propose a 3D deformation mechanism to increase the generalization ability of the pipeline. Extensive experiments show that the proposed pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance on category-level tasks. Further, the experiments demonstrate that the proposed rotation representation is more suitable for the pose estimation tasks than other rotation representations.", "label": 1, "field": "cs"}

We accomplish this by employing a suitable normalization technique on the original sample covariance matrix. Following this, we establish a harmonic central limit theorem for linear spectral statistics within this expansive framework. This achievement effectively eliminates the necessity for a bounded spectral norm on the population covariance matrix and relaxes constraints on the rates of dimension $p$ and sample size $n$, thereby significantly broadening the applicability of these results in the field of high-dimensional statistics.

The system is integrated with the ABM method for fractional-order equations. Beside the standard stability analysis of equilibria, the divergence of fractional order is proposed to determine the instability of the equilibria. The bifurcation diagrams versus the fractional order, and versus one parameter, reveal a strange phenomenon suggesting that the bifurcation branches generated by initial conditions outside neighborhoods of unstable equilibria are spurious sets although they look similar with those generated by initial conditions close to the equilibria. These spurious sets look ``delayed'' in the considered bifurcation scenario. Once the integration step-size is reduced, the spurious branches maintain their shapes but tend to the branches obtained from initial condition within neighborhoods of equilibria. While the spurious branches move once the integration step size reduces, the branches generated by the initial conditions near the equilibria maintain their positions in the considered bifurcation space. This phenomenon does not depend on the integration-time interval, and repeats in the parameter bifurcation space.", "label": 1, "field": "math"}

{"text": "Title: Theory inspired deep network for instantaneous-frequency extraction and signal components recovery from discrete blind-source data\nAbstract: This paper is concerned with the inverse problem of recovering the unknown signal components, along with extraction of their instantaneous frequencies (IFs), governed by the adaptive harmonic model (AHM), from discrete (and possibly non-uniform) samples of the blind-source composite signal. None of the existing decomposition methods and algorithms, including the most popular empirical mode decomposition (EMD) computational scheme and its current modifications, is capable of solving this inverse problem. In order to meet the AHM formulation and to extract the IFs of the decomposed components, called intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), each IMF of EMD is extended to an analytic function in the upper half of the complex plane via the Hilbert transform, followed by taking the real part of the polar form of the analytic extension. Unfortunately, this approach most often fails to resolve the inverse problem satisfactorily. More recently, to resolve the inverse problem, the notion of synchrosqueezed wavelet transform (SST) was proposed by Daubechies and Maes, and further developed in many other papers, while a more direct method, called signal separation operation (SSO), was proposed and developed in our previous work published in the journal, Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis, vol. 30(2):243-261, 2016.

{"text": "Title: On the lack of external response of a nonlinear medium in the second-harmonic generation process\nAbstract: This paper concerns the scattering problem for a nonlinear medium of compact support, $D$, with second-harmonic generation. Such a medium, when probed with monochromatic light beams at frequency $\\omega$, generates additional waves at frequency $2\\omega$. The response of the medium is governed by a system of two coupled semilinear partial differential equations for the electric fields at frequency $\\omega$ and $2\\omega$. We investigate whether there are situations in which the generated $2\\omega$ wave is localized inside $D$, that is, the nonlinear interaction of the medium with the probing wave is invisible to an outside observer. This leads to the analysis of a semilinear elliptic system formulated in $D$ with non-standard boundary conditions. The analysis presented here sets up a mathematical framework needed to investigate a multitude of questions related to nonlinear scattering with second-harmonic generation.", "label": 0, "field": "math"}
{"text": "Title: Introducing Packet-Level Analysis in Programmable Data Planes to Advance Network Intrusion Detection\nAbstract: Programmable data planes offer precise control over the low-level processing steps applied to network packets, serving as a valuable tool for analysing malicious flows in the field of intrusion detection. Albeit with limitations on physical resources and capabilities, they allow for the efficient extraction of detailed traffic information, which can then be utilised by Machine Learning (ML) algorithms responsible for identifying security threats. In addressing resource constraints, existing solutions in the literature rely on compressing network data through the collection of statistical traffic features in the data plane. While this compression saves memory resources in switches and minimises the burden on the control channel between the data and the control plane, it also results in a loss of information available to the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS), limiting access to packet payload, categorical features, and the semantic understanding of network communications, such as the behaviour of packets within traffic flows. This paper proposes P4DDLe, a framework that exploits the flexibility of P4-based programmable data planes for packet-level feature extraction and pre-processing. P4DDLe leverages the programmable data plane to extract raw packet features from the network traffic, categorical features included, and to organise them in a way that the semantics of traffic flows are preserved. To minimise memory and control channel overheads, P4DDLe selectively processes and filters packet-level data, so that only the features required by the NIDS are collected. The experimental evaluation with recent Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack data demonstrates that the proposed approach is very efficient in collecting compact and high-quality representations of network flows, ensuring precise detection of DDoS attacks.", "label": 0, "field": "cs"}

We first derive two different lower bounds to the compression ratio that depend on the number of states of the lossless encoder. Both bounds are asymptotically achievable by conceptually simple coding schemes. We then show that when the number of states of the lossless encoder is large enough in terms of the reconstruction block-length, the performance can be improved, sometimes significantly so. In particular, the improved performance is achievable using a random-coding ensemble that is universal, not only in terms of the source sequence, but also in terms of the distortion measure.", "label": 0, "field": "cs"}

{"text": "Title: Regularity for Maxwell eigenproblems in photonic crystal fibre modelling\nAbstract: The convergence behaviour and the design of numerical methods for modelling the flow of light in photonic crystal fibres depend critically on an understanding of the regularity of solutions to time-harmonic Maxwell equations in a three-dimensional, periodic, translationally invariant, heterogeneous medium. In this paper we determine the strength of the dominant singularities that occur at the interface between materials. By modifying earlier regularity theory for polygonal interfaces we find that on each subdomain, where the material in the fibre is constant, the regularity of in-plane components of the magnetic field are $H^{2-\\eta}$ for all $\\eta > 0$. This estimate is sharp in the sense that these components do not belong to $H^2$, in general. However, global regularity is restricted by the presence of an interface between these subdomains and the interface conditions imply only $H^{3/2-\\eta}$ regularity across the interface. The results are useful to anyone applying a numerical method such as a finite element method or a planewave expansion method to model photonic crystal fibres or similar materials.", "label": 1, "field": "math"}

This captures many classical problems which are solved using DP such as the knapsack problem, the airplane refueling problem, and the minimal-weight polygon triangulation problem. We observe that for many of these problems, the tensor naturally has low tensor rank or low slice rank. We then give new algorithms and a web of fine-grained reductions to tightly determine the complexity of these problems. For instance, we show that a polynomial speedup over the DP algorithm is possible when the tensor rank is a constant or the slice rank is 1, but that such a speedup is impossible if the tensor rank is slightly super-constant (assuming SETH) or the slice rank is at least 3 (assuming the APSP conjecture).

{"text": "Title: The Equity Framework: Fairness Beyond Equalized Predictive Outcomes\nAbstract: Machine Learning (ML) decision-making algorithms are now widely used in predictive decision-making, for example, to determine who to admit and give a loan. Their wide usage and consequential effects on individuals led the ML community to question and raise concerns on how the algorithms differently affect different people and communities. In this paper, we study fairness issues that arise when decision-makers use models (proxy models) that deviate from the models that depict the physical and social environment in which the decisions are situated (intended models). We also highlight the effect of obstacles on individual access and utilization of the models. To this end, we formulate an Equity Framework that considers equal access to the model, equal outcomes from the model, and equal utilization of the model, and consequentially achieves equity and higher social welfare than current fairness notions that aim for equality. We show how the three main aspects of the framework are connected and provide an equity scoring algorithm and questions to guide decision-makers towards equitable decision-making. We show how failure to consider access, outcome, and utilization would exacerbate proxy gaps leading to an infinite inequity loop that reinforces structural inequities through inaccurate and incomplete ground truth curation. We, therefore, recommend a more critical look at the model design and its effect on equity and a shift towards equity achieving predictive decision-making models.", "label": 1, "field": "cs"}

In particular, when the intersection is not at the origin or forms a half-line with the origin as the endpoint, the obtained convergence rate can be exact because a lower bound of the convergence rate is evaluated. These results coincide with the worst-case convergence rate obtained from the error bound discussed in [Borwein et al., SIOPT, 2014] and [Drusvyatskiy et al., Math. Prog., 2017]. Moreover, we consider the convergence rate of the APM for the intersection of an affine subspace and the product of two second-order cones.

We refer to this cluster of capabilities as \"autonomous replication and adaptation\" or ARA. We believe that systems capable of ARA could have wide-reaching and hard-to-anticipate consequences, and that measuring and forecasting ARA may be useful for informing measures around security, monitoring, and alignment. Additionally, once a system is capable of ARA, placing bounds on a system's capabilities may become significantly more difficult. We construct four simple example agents that combine language models with tools that allow them to take actions in the world. We then evaluate these agents on 12 tasks relevant to ARA. We find that these language model agents can only complete the easiest tasks from this list, although they make some progress on the more challenging tasks. Unfortunately, these evaluations are not adequate to rule out the possibility that near-future agents will be capable of ARA. In particular, we do not think that these evaluations provide good assurance that the ``next generation'' of language models (e.g. 100x effective compute scaleup on existing models) will not yield agents capable of ARA, unless intermediate evaluations are performed during pretraining. Relatedly, we expect that fine-tuning of the existing models could produce substantially more competent agents, even if the fine-tuning is not directly targeted at ARA.", "label": 0, "field": "cs"}
{"text": "Title: Training-free Content Injection using h-space in Diffusion Models\nAbstract: Diffusion models (DMs) synthesize high-quality images in various domains. However, controlling their generative process is still hazy because the intermediate variables in the process are not rigorously studied. Recently, the bottleneck feature of the U-Net, namely $h$-space, is found to convey the semantics of the resulting image. It enables StyleCLIP-like latent editing within DMs. In this paper, we explore further usage of $h$-space beyond attribute editing, and introduce a method to inject the content of one image into another image by combining their features in the generative processes. Briefly, given the original generative process of the other image, 1) we gradually blend the bottleneck feature of the content with proper normalization, and 2) we calibrate the skip connections to match the injected content. Unlike custom-diffusion approaches, our method does not require time-consuming optimization or fine-tuning. Instead, our method manipulates intermediate features within a feed-forward generative process. Furthermore, our method does not require supervision from external networks.

{"text": "Title: BA-SAM: Scalable Bias-Mode Attention Mask for Segment Anything Model\nAbstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of image resolution variation for the Segment Anything Model (SAM). SAM, known for its zero-shot generalizability, exhibits a performance degradation when faced with datasets with varying image sizes. Previous approaches tend to resize the image to a fixed size or adopt structure modifications, hindering the preservation of SAM's rich prior knowledge. Besides, such task-specific tuning necessitates a complete retraining of the model, which is cost-expensive and unacceptable for deployment in the downstream tasks. In this paper, we reformulate this issue as a length extrapolation problem, where token sequence length varies while maintaining a consistent patch size for images of different sizes. To this end, we propose Scalable Bias-Mode Attention Mask (BA-SAM) to enhance SAM's adaptability to varying image resolutions while eliminating the need for structure modifications. Firstly, we introduce a new scaling factor to ensure consistent magnitude in the attention layer's dot product values when the token sequence length changes. Secondly, we present a bias-mode attention mask that allows each token to prioritize neighboring information, mitigating the impact of untrained distant information. Our BA-SAM demonstrates efficacy in two scenarios: zero-shot and fine-tuning. Extensive evaluation on diverse datasets, including DIS5K, DUTS, ISIC, COD10K, and COCO, reveals its ability to significantly mitigate performance degradation in the zero-shot setting and achieve state-of-the-art performance with minimal fine-tuning.

A complete finite prefix of a P/T Petri net's unfolding contains all information to verify, e.g., reachability of markings. We unite these two concepts and define complete finite prefixes of the symbolic unfolding of high-level Petri nets. For a class of safe high-level Petri nets, we generalize the well-known algorithm by Esparza et al. for constructing small such prefixes. We evaluate this extended algorithm through a prototype implementation on four novel benchmark families.

However, in most APR studies the train and test sets are chosen from the same set of projects. In reality, however, APR models are meant to be generalizable to new and different projects. Therefore, there is a potential threat that reported APR models with high effectiveness perform poorly when the characteristics of the new project or its bugs are different than the training set's(Domain Shift).

{"text": "Title: Where You Are Is Who You Are: User Identification by Matching Statistics\nAbstract: Most users of online services have unique behavioral or usage patterns. These behavioral patterns can be exploited to identify and track users by using only the observed patterns in the behavior. We study the task of identifying users from statistics of their behavioral patterns. Specifically, we focus on the setting in which we are given histograms of users' data collected during two different experiments. We assume that, in the first dataset, the users' identities are anonymized or hidden and that, in the second dataset, their identities are known. We study the task of identifying the users by matching the histograms of their data in the first dataset with the histograms from the second dataset. In recent works, the optimal algorithm for this user identification task is introduced. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of this method on three different types of datasets and in multiple scenarios. Using datasets such as call data records, web browsing histories, and GPS trajectories, we show that a large fraction of users can be easily identified given only histograms of their data; hence these histograms can act as users' fingerprints. We also verify that simultaneous identification of users achieves better performance compared to one-by-one user identification. We show that using the optimal method for identification gives higher identification accuracy than heuristics-based approaches in practical scenarios. The accuracy obtained under this optimal method can thus be used to quantify the maximum level of user identification that is possible in such settings. We show that the key factors affecting the accuracy of the optimal identification algorithm are the duration of the data collection, the number of users in the anonymized dataset, and the resolution of the dataset.

{"text": "Title: Sharper Bounds for $\\ell_p$ Sensitivity Sampling\nAbstract: In large scale machine learning, random sampling is a popular way to approximate datasets by a small representative subset of examples. In particular, sensitivity sampling is an intensely studied technique which provides provable guarantees on the quality of approximation, while reducing the number of examples to the product of the VC dimension $d$ and the total sensitivity $\\mathfrak S$ in remarkably general settings. However, guarantees going beyond this general bound of $\\mathfrak S d$ are known in perhaps only one setting, for $\\ell_2$ subspace embeddings, despite intense study of sensitivity sampling in prior work. In this work, we show the first bounds for sensitivity sampling for $\\ell_p$ subspace embeddings for $p > 2$ that improve over the general $\\mathfrak S d$ bound, achieving a bound of roughly $\\mathfrak S^{2-2/p}$ for $2<p<\\infty$. Furthermore, our techniques yield further new results in the study of sampling algorithms, showing that the root leverage score sampling algorithm achieves a bound of roughly $d$ for $1\\leq p<2$, and that a combination of leverage score and sensitivity sampling achieves an improved bound of roughly $d^{2/p}\\mathfrak S^{2-4/p}$ for $2<p<\\infty$.

{"text": "Title: The Effect of Learning Strategy versus Inherent Architecture Properties on the Ability of Convolutional Neural Networks to Develop Transformation Invariance\nAbstract: As object recognition becomes an increasingly common ML task, and recent research demonstrating CNNs vulnerability to attacks and small image perturbations necessitate fully understanding the foundations of object recognition. We focus on understanding the mechanisms behind how neural networks generalize to spatial transformations of complex objects. While humans excel at discriminating between objects shown at new positions, orientations, and scales, past results demonstrate that this may be limited to familiar objects - humans demonstrate low tolerance of spatial-variances for purposefully constructed novel objects. Because training artificial neural networks from scratch is similar to showing novel objects to humans, we seek to understand the factors influencing the tolerance of CNNs to spatial transformations. We conduct a thorough empirical examination of seven Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. By training on a controlled face image dataset, we measure model accuracy across different degrees of 5 transformations: position, size, rotation, Gaussian blur, and resolution transformation due to resampling. We also examine how learning strategy affects generalizability by examining how different amounts of pre-training have on model robustness. Overall, we find that the most significant contributor to transformation invariance is pre-training on a large, diverse image dataset. Moreover, while AlexNet tends to be the least robust network, VGG and ResNet architectures demonstrate higher robustness for different transformations. Along with kernel visualizations and qualitative analyses, we examine differences between learning strategy and inherent architectural properties in contributing to invariance of transformations, providing valuable information towards understanding how to achieve greater robustness to transformations in CNNs.", "label": 1, "field": "cs"}

This task is particularly challenging for real-world acquisitions due to factors like noise, outliers, non-uniform sampling, and missing data. Traditional approaches often simplify the problem by imposing handcrafted priors on either the input point clouds or the resulting surface, a process that can necessitate tedious hyperparameter tuning. Conversely, deep learning models have the capability to directly learn the properties of input point clouds and desired surfaces from data. We study the influence of these handcrafted and learned priors on the precision and robustness of surface reconstruction techniques.

With the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI), data anonymization augments the likelihood of covering up necessary sensitive information; preventing data leakage and information loss. OpenWiFi networks are vulnerable to any adversary who is trying to gain access or knowledge on traffic regardless of the knowledge possessed by data owners. The odds for discovery of actual traffic information is addressed by applied conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN). CTGAN yields synthetic data; which disguises as actual data but fostering hidden acute information of actual data. In this paper, the similarity assessment of synthetic with actual data is showcased in terms of clustering algorithms followed by a comparison of performance for unsupervised cluster validation metrics.

The focus of this work is on the design of a robust discretization accounting for slanted and multibranch wells with the ability to simulate both transient behavior such as well opening as well as coupled simulations at the time scale of the reservoir. It is based on a staggered finite volume scheme in space combined with a fully implicit Euler time integration. The construction of consistent and stable numerical fluxes is a key feature for a robust numerical method. It is achieved by combining a monotone flux approximation for the phase superficial velocities with an upwind approximation of the phase molar fractions, density and enthalpy. In order to facilitate the coupling of the well and reservoir models, the Newton linearization accounts for the elimination of the hydrodynamical unknowns leading to Jacobian systems using the same primary unknowns than those of the reservoir model.

Many of the familiar transforms, e.g., the wavelet, shearlet and Gabor transform, both their discrete and continuous variants, are GTI systems. Under a technical $\\alpha$ local integrability condition ($\\alpha$-LIC) we characterize when GTI systems constitute tight and dual frames that yield reproducing formulas for $L^2(G)$. This generalizes results on generalized shift invariant systems, where each $P_j$ is assumed to be countable and each $\\Gamma_j$ is a uniform lattice in $G$, to the case of uncountably many generators and (not necessarily discrete) closed, co-compact subgroups. Furthermore, even in the case of uniform lattices $\\Gamma_j$, our characterizations improve known results since the class of GTI systems satisfying the $\\alpha$-LIC is strictly larger than the class of GTI systems satisfying the previously used local integrability condition.

We investigate how the properties of natural language data affect an LSTM's ability to learn a nonlinguistic task: recalling elements from its input. We find that models trained on natural language data are able to recall tokens from much longer sequences than models trained on non-language sequential data. Furthermore, we show that the LSTM learns to solve the memorization task by explicitly using a subset of its neurons to count timesteps in the input.

The presence of the Carleman Weight Function (CWF) in the resulting regularization functional ensures the global convergence of the gradient descent method of the minimization of this functional to the true solution of the CIP, as long as the noise level tends to zero. The CWF is the function, which is used as the weight in the Carleman estimate for the corresponding Partial Differential Operator. Numerical studies demonstrate an accurate reconstruction of unknown coefficients as well as S,I,R functions inside of that city. As a by-product, uniqueness theorem for this CIP is proven.

{"text": "Title: A direct approach for function approximation on data defined manifolds\nAbstract: In much of the literature on function approximation by deep networks, the function is assumed to be defined on some known domain, such as a cube or a sphere. In practice, the data might not be dense on these domains, and therefore, the approximation theory results are observed to be too conservative. In manifold learning, one assumes instead that the data is sampled from an unknown manifold; i.e., the manifold is defined by the data itself. Function approximation on this unknown manifold is then a two stage procedure: first, one approximates the Laplace-Beltrami operator (and its eigen-decomposition) on this manifold using a graph Laplacian, and next, approximates the target function using the eigen-functions. Alternatively, one estimates first some atlas on the manifold and then uses local approximation techniques based on the local coordinate charts. In this paper, we propose a more direct approach to function approximation on \\emph{unknown}, data defined manifolds without computing the eigen-decomposition of some operator or an atlas for the manifold, and without any kind of training in the classical sense. Our constructions are universal; i.e., do not require the knowledge of any prior on the target function other than continuity on the manifold. We estimate the degree of approximation. For smooth functions, the estimates do not suffer from the so-called saturation phenomenon. We demonstrate via a property called good propagation of errors how the results can be lifted for function approximation using deep networks where each channel evaluates a Gaussian network on a possibly unknown manifold.", "label": 1, "field": "cs"}

In an effort to derive a formulation for practical settings, we consider limited and unknown sensor field-of-views (FoVs), sensors with limited local computational resources and communication channel capacity. The resulting distributed multi-object tracking algorithm involves solving an NP-hard multidimensional assignment problem either optimally for small-size problems or sub-optimally for general practical problems. For general problems, we propose an efficient distributed multi-object tracking algorithm that performs track-to-track fusion using a clustering-based analysis of the state space transformed into a density space to mitigate the complexity of the assignment problem. The proposed algorithm can more efficiently group local track estimates for fusion than existing approaches. To ensure we achieve globally consistent identities for tracks across a network of nodes as objects move between FoVs, we develop a graph-based algorithm to achieve label consensus and minimise track segmentation.

This has limited their applications in many scenarios (e.g., autonomous systems, supersonic flows) that have a limited energy budget and require near real-time response. Leveraging optical computing, this paper develops an on-chip training framework for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), aiming to solve high-dimensional PDEs with fJ/MAC photonic power consumption and ultra-low latency. Despite the ultra-high speed of optical neural networks, training a PINN on an optical chip is hard due to (1) the large size of photonic devices, and (2) the lack of scalable optical memory devices to store the intermediate results of back-propagation (BP). To enable realistic optical PINN training, this paper presents a scalable method to avoid the BP process. We also employ a tensor-compressed approach to improve the convergence and scalability of our optical PINN training. This training framework is designed with tensorized optical neural networks (TONN) for scalable inference acceleration and MZI phase-domain tuning for \\textit{in-situ} optimization.

Similar benefits of perfect delayed CSIT were revealed in recent work by Kobayashi et al., Yang et al., and Gou and Jafar, which extended the above to the case of perfect delayed CSIT and imperfect current CSIT. The work here considers the general problem of communicating, over the aforementioned broadcast channel, with imperfect delayed and imperfect current CSIT, and reveals that even substantially degraded and imperfect delayed-CSIT is in fact sufficient to achieve the aforementioned gains previously associated to perfect delayed CSIT. The work proposes novel multi-phase broadcasting schemes that properly utilize knowledge of imperfect delayed and imperfect current CSIT, to match in many cases the optimal degrees-of-freedom (DoF) region achieved with perfect delayed CSIT.

In this paper, we propose a novel marginal debiased network (MDN) to learn debiased representations. More specifically, a marginal softmax loss (MSL) is designed by introducing the idea of margin penalty into the fairness problem, which assigns a larger margin for bias-conflicting samples (data without spurious correlations) than for bias-aligned ones, so as to deemphasize the spurious correlations and improve generalization on unbiased test criteria. To determine the margins, our MDN is optimized through a meta learning framework. We propose a meta equalized loss (MEL) to perceive the model fairness, and adaptively update the margin parameters by metaoptimization which requires the trained model guided by the optimal margins should minimize MEL computed on an unbiased meta-validation set.

{"text": "Title: Faster Projection-Free Augmented Lagrangian Methods via Weak Proximal Oracle\nAbstract: This paper considers a convex composite optimization problem with affine constraints, which includes problems that take the form of minimizing a smooth convex objective function over the intersection of (simple) convex sets, or regularized with multiple (simple) functions. Motivated by high-dimensional applications in which exact projection/proximal computations are not tractable, we propose a \\textit{projection-free} augmented Lagrangian-based method, in which primal updates are carried out using a \\textit{weak proximal oracle} (WPO). In an earlier work, WPO was shown to be more powerful than the standard \\textit{linear minimization oracle} (LMO) that underlies conditional gradient-based methods (aka Frank-Wolfe methods). Moreover, WPO is computationally tractable for many high-dimensional problems of interest, including those motivated by recovery of low-rank matrices and tensors, and optimization over polytopes which admit efficient LMOs. The main result of this paper shows that under a certain curvature assumption (which is weaker than strong convexity), our WPO-based algorithm achieves an ergodic rate of convergence of $O(1/T)$ for both the objective residual and feasibility gap. This result, to the best of our knowledge, improves upon the $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ rate for existing LMO-based projection-free methods for this class of problems.

Given that each neural coding scheme possesses its own merits and drawbacks, these SNNs encounter challenges in achieving optimal performance such as accuracy, response time, efficiency, and robustness, all of which are crucial for practical applications. In this study, we argue that SNN architectures should be holistically designed to incorporate heterogeneous coding schemes. As an initial exploration in this direction, we propose a hybrid neural coding and learning framework, which encompasses a neural coding zoo with diverse neural coding schemes discovered in neuroscience. Additionally, it incorporates a flexible neural coding assignment strategy to accommodate task-specific requirements, along with novel layer-wise learning methods to effectively implement hybrid coding SNNs. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework on image classification and sound localization tasks. Specifically, the proposed hybrid coding SNNs achieve comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art SNNs, while exhibiting significantly reduced inference latency and energy consumption, as well as high noise robustness.

We first show that speed partitioning will significantly reduce the search space expansion which has direct impacts on query performance of the indexes. Next we formulate the optimal speed partitioning problem based on search space expansion analysis and then compute the optimal solution using dynamic programming.

Coordination is required also for identifying discovered and disclosed software vulnerabilities with Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).

Objective: The paper observes the historical time delays between the assignment of CVEs on a mailing list and the later appearance of these in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Drawing from research on software engineering coordination, software vulnerabilities, and bug tracking, the delays are modeled through three dimensions: social networks and communication practices, tracking infrastructures, and the technical characteristics of the CVEs coordinated. Method: Given a period between 2008 and 2016, a sample of over five thousand CVEs is used to model the delays with nearly fifty explanatory metrics. Regression analysis is used for the modeling. Results: The results show that the CVE coordination delays are affected by different abstractions for noise and prerequisite constraints. These abstractions convey effects from the social network and infrastructure dimensions. Particularly strong effect sizes are observed for annual and monthly control metrics, a control metric for weekends, the degrees of the nodes in the CVE coordination networks, and the number of references given in NVD for the CVEs archived.

While simple to state, this has been a particularly challenging problem in deep learning, where models often end up making overconfident predictions in such situations. In this work we present a simple, but highly effective approach to deal with out-of-distribution detection that uses the principle of abstention: when encountering a sample from an unseen class, the desired behavior is to abstain from predicting. Our approach uses a network with an extra abstention class and is trained on a dataset that is augmented with an uncurated set that consists of a large number of out-of-distribution (OoD) samples that are assigned the label of the abstention class; the model is then trained to learn an effective discriminator between in and out-of-distribution samples. We compare this relatively simple approach against a wide variety of more complex methods that have been proposed both for out-of-distribution detection as well as uncertainty modeling in deep learning, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness on a wide variety of of benchmarks and deep architectures for image recognition and text classification, often outperforming existing approaches by significant margins.

{"text": "Title: Person Re-identification: Implicitly Defining the Receptive Fields of Deep Learning Classification Frameworks\nAbstract: The \\emph{receptive fields} of deep learning classification models determine the regions of the input data that have the most significance for providing correct decisions. The primary way to learn such receptive fields is to train the models upon masked data, which helps the networks to ignore any unwanted regions, but has two major drawbacks: 1) it often yields edge-sensitive decision processes; and 2) augments the computational cost of the inference phase considerably. This paper describes a solution for implicitly driving the inference of the networks' receptive fields, by creating synthetic learning data composed of interchanged segments that should be \\emph{apriori} important/irrelevant for the network decision. In practice, we use a segmentation module to distinguish between the foreground (important)/background (irrelevant) parts of each learning instance, and randomly swap segments between image pairs, while keeping the class label exclusively consistent with the label of the deemed important segments. This strategy typically drives the networks to early convergence and appropriate solutions, where the identity and clutter descriptions are not correlated. Moreover, this data augmentation solution has various interesting properties: 1) it is parameter-free; 2) it fully preserves the label information; and, 3) it is compatible with the typical data augmentation techniques. In the empirical validation, we considered the person re-identification problem and evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed solution in the well-known \\emph{Richly Annotated Pedestrian} (RAP) dataset for two different settings (\\emph{upper-body} and \\emph{full-body}), observing highly competitive results over the state-of-the-art.

Current sparse-view 3D inference methods typically rely on camera poses to geometrically aggregate information from input views, but are not robust in-the-wild when such information is unavailable/inaccurate. In contrast, UpFusion sidesteps this requirement by learning to implicitly leverage the available images as context in a conditional generative model for synthesizing novel views. We incorporate two complementary forms of conditioning into diffusion models for leveraging the input views: a) via inferring query-view aligned features using a scene-level transformer, b) via intermediate attentional layers that can directly observe the input image tokens. We show that this mechanism allows generating high-fidelity novel views while improving the synthesis quality given additional (unposed) images. We evaluate our approach on the Co3Dv2 and Google Scanned Objects datasets and demonstrate the benefits of our method over pose-reliant sparse-view methods as well as single-view methods that cannot leverage additional views.

We formulate the signal detection as obtaining the marginals of the a posteriori probability distribution of the transmitted symbol vector. Then, a maximization of the a posteriori marginals (MPM) for signal detection can be performed. With the information geometry theory, we calculate the approximations of the a posteriori marginals. It is formulated as an iterative m-projection process between submanifolds with different constraints. We then apply the central-limit-theorem (CLT) to simplify the calculation of the m-projection since the direct calculation of the m-projection is of exponential-complexity. With the CLT, we obtain an approximate solution of the m-projection, which is asymptotically accurate. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IGA-SD emerges as a promising and efficient method to implement the signal detector in ultra-massive MIMO systems.", "label": 0, "field": "cs"}

{"text": "Title: Understanding Softmax Confidence and Uncertainty\nAbstract: It is often remarked that neural networks fail to increase their uncertainty when predicting on data far from the training distribution. Yet naively using softmax confidence as a proxy for uncertainty achieves modest success in tasks exclusively testing for this, e.g., out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. This paper investigates this contradiction, identifying two implicit biases that do encourage softmax confidence to correlate with epistemic uncertainty: 1) Approximately optimal decision boundary structure, and 2) Filtering effects of deep networks. It describes why low-dimensional intuitions about softmax confidence are misleading. Diagnostic experiments quantify reasons softmax confidence can fail, finding that extrapolations are less to blame than overlap between training and OOD data in final-layer representations. Pre-trained/fine-tuned networks reduce this overlap.", "label": 1, "field": "cs"}
{"text": "Title: Towards an Automatic System for Extracting Planar Orientations from Software Generated Point Clouds\nAbstract: In geology, a key activity is the characterisation of geological structures (surface formation topology and rock units) using Planar Orientation measurements such as Strike, Dip and Dip Direction. In general these measurements are collected manually using basic equipment; usually a compass/clinometer and a backboard, recorded on a map by hand. Various computing techniques and technologies, such as Lidar, have been utilised in order to automate this process and update the collection paradigm for these types of measurements. Techniques such as Structure from Motion (SfM) reconstruct of scenes and objects by generating a point cloud from input images, with detailed reconstruction possible on the decimetre scale. SfM-type techniques provide advantages in areas of cost and usability in more varied environmental conditions, while sacrificing the extreme levels of data fidelity. Here is presented a methodology of data acquisition and a Machine Learning-based software system: GeoStructure, developed to automate the measurement of orientation measurements. Rather than deriving measurements using a method applied to the input images, such as the Hough Transform, this method takes measurements directly from the reconstructed point cloud surfaces. Point cloud noise is mitigated using a Mahalanobis distance implementation. Significant structure is characterised using a k-nearest neighbour region growing algorithm, and final surface orientations are quantified using the plane, and normal direction cosines.", "label": 1, "field": "cs"}

{"text": "Title: Channel Estimation for FAS-assisted Multiuser mmWave Systems\nAbstract: This letter investigates the challenge of channel estimation in a multiuser millimeter-wave (mmWave) time-division duplexing (TDD) system. In this system, the base station (BS) employs a multi-antenna uniform linear array (ULA), while each mobile user is equipped with a fluid antenna system (FAS). Accurate channel state information (CSI) plays a crucial role in the precise placement of antennas in FAS. Traditional channel estimation methods designed for fixed-antenna systems are inadequate due to the high dimensionality of FAS. To address this issue, we propose a low-sample-size sparse channel reconstruction (L3SCR) method, capitalizing on the sparse propagation paths characteristic of mmWave channels. In this approach, each fluid antenna only needs to switch and measure the channel at a few specific locations. By observing this reduced-dimensional data, we can effectively extract angular and gain information related to the sparse channel, enabling us to reconstruct the full CSI. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method allows us to obtain precise CSI with minimal hardware switching and pilot overhead. As a result, the system sum-rate approaches the upper bound achievable with perfect CSI.", "label": 0, "field": "cs"}

{"text": "Title: Profinite equivariant spectra and their tensor-triangular geometry\nAbstract: We study the tensor-triangular geometry of the category of equivariant $G$-spectra for $G$ a profinite group, $\\mathsf{Sp}_G$. Our starting point is the construction of a ``continuous'' model for this category, which we show agrees with all other models in the literature. We describe the Balmer spectrum of finite $G$-spectra up to the ambiguity that is present in the finite group case; in particular, we obtain a thick subcategory theorem when $G$ is abelian. By verifying the bijectivity hypothesis for $\\mathsf{Sp}_G$, we prove a nilpotence theorem for all profinite groups. Our study then moves to the realm of rational $G$-equivariant spectra.

{"text": "Title: Compensating trajectory bias for unsupervised patient stratification using adversarial recurrent neural networks\nAbstract: Electronic healthcare records are an important source of information which can be used in patient stratification to discover novel disease phenotypes. However, they can be challenging to work with as data is often sparse and irregularly sampled. One approach to solve these limitations is learning dense embeddings that represent individual patient trajectories using a recurrent neural network autoencoder (RNN-AE). This process can be susceptible to unwanted data biases. We show that patient embeddings and clusters using previously proposed RNN-AE models might be impacted by a trajectory bias, meaning that results are dominated by the amount of data contained in each patients trajectory, instead of clinically relevant details. We investigate this bias on 2 datasets (from different hospitals) and 2 disease areas as well as using different parts of the patient trajectory. Our results using 2 previously published baseline methods indicate a particularly strong bias in case of an event-to-end trajectory. We present a method that can overcome this issue using an adversarial training scheme on top of a RNN-AE. Our results show that our approach can reduce the trajectory bias in all cases.", "label": 1, "field": "cs"}

Opportunities and Challenges from Task Oriented and Secure Communications to Integrated Sensing\nAbstract: This paper explores opportunities and challenges of task (goal)-oriented and semantic communications for next-generation (NextG) communication networks through the integration of multi-task learning. This approach employs deep neural networks representing a dedicated encoder at the transmitter and multiple task-specific decoders at the receiver, collectively trained to handle diverse tasks including semantic information preservation, source input reconstruction, and integrated sensing and communications. To extend the applicability from point-to-point links to multi-receiver settings, we envision the deployment of decoders at various receivers, where decentralized learning addresses the challenges of communication load and privacy concerns, leveraging federated learning techniques that distribute model updates across decentralized nodes. However, the efficacy of this approach is contingent on the robustness of the employed deep learning models. We scrutinize potential vulnerabilities stemming from adversarial attacks during both training and testing phases. These attacks aim to manipulate both the inputs at the encoder at the transmitter and the signals received over the air on the receiver side, highlighting the importance of fortifying semantic communications against potential multi-domain exploits.

{"text": "Title: Learning nonlinear level sets for dimensionality reduction in function approximation\nAbstract: We developed a Nonlinear Level-set Learning (NLL) method for dimensionality reduction in high-dimensional function approximation with small data. This work is motivated by a variety of design tasks in real-world engineering applications, where practitioners would replace their computationally intensive physical models (e.g., high-resolution fluid simulators) with fast-to-evaluate predictive machine learning models, so as to accelerate the engineering design processes. There are two major challenges in constructing such predictive models: (a) high-dimensional inputs (e.g., many independent design parameters) and (b) small training data, generated by running extremely time-consuming simulations. Thus, reducing the input dimension is critical to alleviate the over-fitting issue caused by data insufficiency. Existing methods, including sliced inverse regression and active subspace approaches, reduce the input dimension by learning a linear coordinate transformation; our main contribution is to extend the transformation approach to a nonlinear regime. Specifically, we exploit reversible networks (RevNets) to learn nonlinear level sets of a high-dimensional function and parameterize its level sets in low-dimensional spaces. A new loss function was designed to utilize samples of the target functions' gradient to encourage the transformed function to be sensitive to only a few transformed coordinates. The NLL approach is demonstrated by applying it to three 2D functions and two 20D functions for showing the improved approximation accuracy with the use of nonlinear transformation, as well as to an 8D composite material design problem for optimizing the buckling-resistance performance of composite shells of rocket inter-stages.", "label": 1, "field": "math"}

{"text": "Title: Improved Training of Sparse Coding Variational Autoencoder via Weight Normalization\nAbstract: Learning a generative model of visual information with sparse and compositional features has been a challenge for both theoretical neuroscience and machine learning communities. Sparse coding models have achieved great success in explaining the receptive fields of mammalian primary visual cortex with sparsely activated latent representation. In this paper, we focus on a recently proposed model, sparse coding variational autoencoder (SVAE) (Barello et al., 2018), and show that the end-to-end training scheme of SVAE leads to a large group of decoding filters not fully optimized with noise-like receptive fields. We propose a few heuristics to improve the training of SVAE and show that a unit $L_2$ norm constraint on the decoder is critical to produce sparse coding filters. Such normalization can be considered as local lateral inhibition in the cortex. We verify this claim empirically on both natural image patches and MNIST dataset and show that projection of the filters onto unit norm drastically increases the number of active filters. Our results highlight the importance of weight normalization for learning sparse representation from data and suggest a new way of reducing the number of inactive latent components in VAE learning.", "label": 1, "field": "cs"}

We scraped over 6.9M posts from incels.is and categorized a random sample into non-violent, explicitly violent, and implicitly violent content. Two human coders annotated 3,028 posts, which we used to tune and evaluate GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models across different prompts and batch sizes regarding coding reliability. The best-performing GPT-4 model annotated an additional 30,000 posts for further analysis. Our findings indicate an overall increase in violent speech overtime on incels.is, both at the community and individual level, particularly among more engaged users. While directed violent language decreases, non-directed violent language increases, and self-harm content shows a decline, especially after 2.5 years of user activity.

Due to the dynamic nature of human behaviours, continual learning promises HAR systems that are tailored to users' needs. However, because of the difficulty in collecting labelled data with wearable sensors, existing approaches that focus on supervised continual learning have limited applicability, while unsupervised continual learning methods only handle representation learning while delaying classifier training to a later stage. This work explores the adoption and adaptation of CaSSLe, a continual self-supervised learning model, and Kaizen, a semi-supervised continual learning model that balances representation learning and down-stream classification, for the task of wearable-based HAR. These schemes re-purpose contrastive learning for knowledge retention and, Kaizen combines that with self-training in a unified scheme that can leverage unlabelled and labelled data for continual learning. In addition to comparing state-of-the-art self-supervised continual learning schemes, we further investigated the importance of different loss terms and explored the trade-off between knowledge retention and learning from new tasks.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-trivial result for SSRP/VSDO beating the trivial $\\tilde{O}(mn)$ computation time for directed graphs with polynomially-bounded edge weights. Such a result has been unknown so far even for the setting of $(1 + \\epsilon)$-approximation. It also implies that the known barrier of $\\Omega(m\\sqrt{n})$ time for the exact SSRP by Chechik and Magen~[ICALP2020] does not apply to the case of approximation.", "label": 0, "field": "cs"}

The weighted analytic classes which we use are the same as those introduced by Guo in 1993 in view of establishing exponential convergence for hp finite element methods in polyhedra. We first give a simple proof of the known weighted analytic regularity in a polygon, relying on a new formulation of elliptic a priori estimates in smooth domains with analytic control of derivatives. The technique is based on dyadic partitions near the corners. This technique can successfully be extended to polyhedra, providing isotropic analytic regularity. This is not optimal, because it does not take advantage of the full regularity along the edges.

{"text": "Title: Minimum Coverage Sets for Training Robust Ad Hoc Teamwork Agents\nAbstract: Robustly cooperating with unseen agents and human partners presents significant challenges due to the diverse cooperative conventions these partners may adopt. Existing Ad Hoc Teamwork (AHT) methods address this challenge by training an agent with a population of diverse teammate policies obtained through maximizing specific diversity metrics. However, prior heuristic-based diversity metrics do not always maximize the agent's robustness in all cooperative problems. In this work, we first propose that maximizing an AHT agent's robustness requires it to emulate policies in the minimum coverage set (MCS), the set of best-response policies to any partner policies in the environment. We then introduce the L-BRDiv algorithm that generates a set of teammate policies that, when used for AHT training, encourage agents to emulate policies from the MCS. L-BRDiv works by solving a constrained optimization problem to jointly train teammate policies for AHT training and approximating AHT agent policies that are members of the MCS. We empirically demonstrate that L-BRDiv produces more robust AHT agents than state-of-the-art methods in a broader range of two-player cooperative problems without the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning for its objectives. Our study shows that L-BRDiv outperforms the baseline methods by prioritizing discovering distinct members of the MCS instead of repeatedly finding redundant policies.", "label": 0, "field": "cs"}

{"text": "Title: Towards Unsupervised Open World Semantic Segmentation\nAbstract: For the semantic segmentation of images, state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve high segmentation accuracy if that task is restricted to a closed set of classes. However, as of now DNNs have limited ability to operate in an open world, where they are tasked to identify pixels belonging to unknown objects and eventually to learn novel classes, incrementally. Humans have the capability to say: I don't know what that is, but I've already seen something like that. Therefore, it is desirable to perform such an incremental learning task in an unsupervised fashion. We introduce a method where unknown objects are clustered based on visual similarity. Those clusters are utilized to define new classes and serve as training data for unsupervised incremental learning. More precisely, the connected components of a predicted semantic segmentation are assessed by a segmentation quality estimate. connected components with a low estimated prediction quality are candidates for a subsequent clustering. Additionally, the component-wise quality assessment allows for obtaining predicted segmentation masks for the image regions potentially containing unknown objects. The respective pixels of such masks are pseudo-labeled and afterwards used for re-training the DNN, i.e., without the use of ground truth generated by humans. In our experiments we demonstrate that, without access to ground truth and even with few data, a DNN's class space can be extended by a novel class, achieving considerable segmentation accuracy.", "label": 1, "field": "cs"}

{"text": "Title: Efficient Algorithms for Learning from Coarse Labels\nAbstract: For many learning problems one may not have access to fine grained label information; e.g., an image can be labeled as husky, dog, or even animal depending on the expertise of the annotator. In this work, we formalize these settings and study the problem of learning from such coarse data. Instead of observing the actual labels from a set $\\mathcal{Z}$, we observe coarse labels corresponding to a partition of $\\mathcal{Z}$ (or a mixture of partitions). Our main algorithmic result is that essentially any problem learnable from fine grained labels can also be learned efficiently when the coarse data are sufficiently informative. We obtain our result through a generic reduction for answering Statistical Queries (SQ) over fine grained labels given only coarse labels. The number of coarse labels required depends polynomially on the information distortion due to coarsening and the number of fine labels $|\\mathcal{Z}|$. We also investigate the case of (infinitely many) real valued labels focusing on a central problem in censored and truncated statistics: Gaussian mean estimation from coarse data.

{"text": "Title: Signed Latent Factors for Spamming Activity Detection\nAbstract: Due to the increasing trend of performing spamming activities (e.g., Web spam, deceptive reviews, fake followers, etc.) on various online platforms to gain undeserved benefits, spam detection has emerged as a hot research issue. Previous attempts to combat spam mainly employ features related to metadata, user behaviors, or relational ties. These works have made considerable progress in understanding and filtering spamming campaigns. However, this problem remains far from fully solved. Almost all the proposed features focus on a limited number of observed attributes or explainable phenomena, making it difficult for existing methods to achieve further improvement. To broaden the vision about solving the spam problem and address long-standing challenges (class imbalance and graph incompleteness) in the spam detection area, we propose a new attempt of utilizing signed latent factors to filter fraudulent activities. The spam-contaminated relational datasets of multiple online applications in this scenario are interpreted by the unified signed network. Two competitive and highly dissimilar algorithms of latent factors mining (LFM) models are designed based on multi-relational likelihoods estimation (LFM-MRLE) and signed pairwise ranking (LFM-SPR), respectively. We then explore how to apply the mined latent factors to spam detection tasks. Experiments on real-world datasets of different kinds of Web applications (social media and Web forum) indicate that LFM models outperform state-of-the-art baselines in detecting spamming activities. By specifically manipulating experimental data, the effectiveness of our methods in dealing with incomplete and imbalanced challenges is valida", "label": 1, "field": "cs"}
{"text": "Title: Answering Queries with Negation over Existential Rules\nAbstract: Ontology-based query answering with existential rules is well understood and implemented for positive queries, in particular conjunctive queries. The situation changes drastically for queries with negation, where there is no agreed-upon semantics or standard implementation. Stratification, as used for Datalog, is not enough for existential rules, since the latter still admit multiple universal models that can differ on negative queries. We therefore propose universal core models as a basis for a meaningful (non-monotonic) semantics for queries with negation. Since cores are hard to compute, we identify syntactic descriptions of queries that can equivalently be answered over other types of models. This leads to fragments of queries with negation that can safely be evaluated by current chase implementations. We establish new techniques to estimate how the core model differs from other universal models, and we incorporate our findings into a new reasoning approach for existential rules with negation.", "label": 1, "field": "cs"}

{"text": "Title: On the hierarchical Bayesian modelling of frequency response functions\nAbstract: For situations that may benefit from information sharing among datasets, e.g., population-based SHM of similar structures, the hierarchical Bayesian approach provides a useful modelling structure. Hierarchical Bayesian models learn statistical distributions at the population (or parent) and the domain levels simultaneously, to bolster statistical strength among the parameters. As a result, variance is reduced among the parameter estimates, particularly when data are limited. In this paper, a combined probabilistic FRF model is developed for a small population of nominally-identical helicopter blades, using a hierarchical Bayesian structure, to support information transfer in the context of sparse data. The modelling approach is also demonstrated in a traditional SHM context, for a single helicopter blade exposed to varying temperatures, to show how the inclusion of physics-based knowledge can improve generalisation beyond the training data, in the context of scarce data. These models address critical challenges in SHM, by accommodating benign variations that present as differences in the underlying dynamics, while also considering (and utilising), the similarities among the domains.", "label": 0, "field": "cs"}

Recently Girao [Combinatorica2023], showed that for every graph $F$ with at least one edge, there is a constant $c_F$ such that there are graphs of arbitrarily large chromatic number and the same clique number as $F$, in which every $F$-free induced subgraph has chromatic number at most $c_F$. We significantly improve the value of the constant $c_F$ for the special case where $F$ is the complete bipartite graph $K_{a,b}$. We show that any $K_{a,b}$-free induced subgraph of the triangle-free shift graph $G_{n,2}$ has chromatic number at most $a+b$. 2. An undirected simple graph $G$ is said to have the AOP Property if it can be acyclically oriented such that there is at most one directed path between any two vertices. We prove that the shift graph $G_{n,2}$ does not have the AOP property for all $n\\geq 9$. We then construct induced subgraphs of shift graph $G_{n,2}$ with an arbitrarily high chromatic number and odd-girth which have the AOP property.

{"text": "Title: Method for Solving State-Path Constrained Optimal Control Problems Using Adaptive Radau Collocation\nAbstract: A new method is developed for accurately approximating the solution to state-variable inequality path constrained optimal control problems using a multiple-domain adaptive Legendre-Gauss-Radau collocation method. The method consists of the following parts. First, a structure detection method is developed to estimate switch times in the activation and deactivation of state-variable inequality path constraints. Second, using the detected structure, the domain is partitioned into multiple-domains where each domain corresponds to either a constrained or an unconstrained segment. Furthermore, additional decision variables are introduced in the multiple-domain formulation, where these additional decision variables represent the switch times of the detected active state-variable inequality path constraints. Within a constrained domain, the path constraint is differentiated with respect to the independent variable until the control appears explicitly, and this derivative is set to zero along the constrained arc while all preceding derivatives are set to zero at the start of the constrained arc. The time derivatives of the active state-variable inequality path constraints are computed using automatic differentiation and the properties of the chain rule. The method is demonstrated on two problems, the first being a benchmark optimal control problem which has a known analytical solution and the second being a challenging problem from the field of aerospace engineering in which there is no known analytical solution. When compared against previously developed adaptive Legendre-Gauss-Radau methods, the results show that the method developed in this paper is capable of computing accurate solutions to problems whose solution contain active state-variable inequality path constraints.", "label": 0, "field": "math"}

Given a point robot moving with bounded speed among transient rectilinear obstacles and a pair of points $s$, $d$, we determine a time-minimal, obstacle-avoiding path from $s$ to $d$. The main challenge in solving this problem arises as the robot may be required to wait for an obstacle to disappear, before it can continue moving toward the destination. Our algorithm builds on the continuous Dijkstra paradigm, which simulates propagating a wavefront from the source point. We also solve a query version of this problem.

Second, we study the influence of the training environment on producing greener models. To investigate these relationships, we collect multiple metrics related to energy efficiency and model correctness during the models' training.

Robust regret is defined relative to the performance of this optimal non-causal control. It is shown that a controller achieves robust regret if and only if it satisfies a robust $H_\\infty$ performance condition. DK-iteration can be used to synthesize a controller that satisfies this condition and hence achieve a given level of robust regret. The approach is demonstrated three examples: (i) a simple single-input, single-output classical design, (ii) a longitudinal control for a simplified model for a Boeing 747 model, and (iii) an active suspension for a quarter car model.

{"text": "Title: Improving the Deployment of Recycling Classification through Efficient Hyper-Parameter Analysis\nAbstract: The paradigm of automated waste classification has recently seen a shift in the domain of interest from conventional image processing techniques to powerful computer vision algorithms known as convolutional neural networks (CNN). Historically, CNNs have demonstrated a strong dependency on powerful hardware for real-time classification, yet the need for deployment on weaker embedded devices is greater than ever. The work in this paper proposes a methodology for reconstructing and tuning conventional image classification models, using EfficientNets, to decrease their parameterisation with no trade-off in model accuracy and develops a pipeline through TensorRT for accelerating such models to run at real-time on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano embedded device. The train-deployment discrepancy, relating how poor data augmentation leads to a discrepancy in model accuracy between training and deployment, is often neglected in many papers and thus the work is extended by analysing and evaluating the impact real world perturbations had on model accuracy once deployed. The scope of the work concerns developing a more efficient variant of WasteNet, a collaborative recycling classification model. The newly developed model scores a test-set accuracy of 95.8% with a real world accuracy of 95%, a 14% increase over the original. Our acceleration pipeline boosted model throughput by 750% to 24 inferences per second on the Jetson Nano and real-time latency of the system was verified through servomotor latency analysis.", "label": 1, "field": "cs"}

However, the inherent limitations of traditional neural networks arise due to their relatively fixed network structures and activation functions. 1, The type of activation function is single and relatively fixed, which leads to poor \"unit representation ability\" of the network, and it is often used to solve simple problems with very complex networks; 2, the network structure is not adaptive, it is easy to cause network structure redundant or insufficient. To address the aforementioned issues, this study proposes a novel neural network called X-Net. By utilizing our designed Alternating Backpropagation mechanism, X-Net dynamically selects appropriate activation functions based on derivative information during training to enhance the network's representation capability for specific tasks. Simultaneously, it accurately adjusts the network structure at the neuron level to accommodate tasks of varying complexities and reduce computational costs. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the dual advantages of X-Net in terms of reducing model size and improving representation power. Specifically, in terms of the number of parameters, X-Net is only 3$\\%$ of baselines on average, and only 1.4$\\%$ under some tasks. In terms of representation ability, X-Net can achieve an average $R^2$=0.985 on the fitting task by only optimizing the activation function without introducing any parameters.

{"text": "Title: Predicting Post-Route Quality of Results Estimates for HLS Designs using Machine Learning\nAbstract: Machine learning (ML) has been widely used to improve the predictability of EDA tools. The use of CAD tools that express designs at higher levels of abstraction makes machine learning even more important to highlight the performance of various design steps. Behavioral descriptions used during the high-level synthesis (HLS) are completely technology independent making it hard for designers to interpret how changes in the synthesis options affect the resultant circuit. FPGA design flows are completely embracing HLS based methodologies so that software engineers with almost no hardware design skills can easily use their tools. HLS tools allow design space exploration by modifying synthesis options, however, they lack accuracy in the Quality of Results (QoR) reported right after HLS. This lack of correctness results in sub-optimal designs with problems in timing closure. This paper presents a robust ML based design flow that can accurately predict post-route QoR for a given behavioral description without the need to synthesize the design. The model is an important design exploration tool where a designer can quickly view the impact on overall design quality when local and global optimization directives are changed. The proposed methodology presents two strong advantages: (i) Accurate prediction of the design quality (QoR), and (ii) complete elimination of the need to execute high-level synthesis for each design option. We predict three post route parameters, (i). Area, (ii). Latency and (iii). Clock Period of a design just by analyzing the high level behavioral code and some intermediate representation codes.

A Heaviside composite function is a composite of a Heaviside function (i.e., the indicator function of either the open $( \\, 0,\\infty )$ or closed $[ \\, 0,\\infty \\, )$ interval) with a possibly nondifferentiable function. Modeling-wise, we show how Heaviside composite optimization provides a unified formulation for learning the optimal multi-class classification and multi-action treatment rules, subject to rule-dependent constraints stipulating a variety of domain restrictions. A Heaviside composite function has an equivalent discrete formulation %in terms of integer variables, and the resulting optimization problem can in principle be solved by integer programming (IP) methods. Nevertheless, for constrained learning problems with large data sets, %of modest or large sizes, a straightforward application of off-the-shelf IP solvers is usually ineffective in achieving global optimality. To alleviate such a computational burden, our major contribution is the proposal of the PIP method by leveraging the effectiveness of state-of-the-art IP solvers for problems of modest sizes. We provide the theoretical advantage of the PIP method with the connection to continuous optimization and show that the computed solution is locally optimal for a broad class of Heaviside composite optimization problems.

We specifically consider the setting where losses are chosen adversarially and contexts are sampled i.i.d. from an unknown distribution.

{"text": "Title: Radar-Camera Pixel Depth Association for Depth Completion\nAbstract: While radar and video data can be readily fused at the detection level, fusing them at the pixel level is potentially more beneficial. This is also more challenging in part due to the sparsity of radar, but also because automotive radar beams are much wider than a typical pixel combined with a large baseline between camera and radar, which results in poor association between radar pixels and color pixel. A consequence is that depth completion methods designed for LiDAR and video fare poorly for radar and video.

Specifically, we study impartial vector subtraction games on tuples of nonnegative integers (Golomb 1966), with finite subtraction sets. In case of two move rulesets we find a complete solution, via a certain \\P-to-\\P\\ principle (where \\P \\ means that the previous player wins). Namely $x \\in \\P$ if and only if $x +a +b \\in \\P$, where $a$ and $b$ are the two move options. Flammenkamp 1997 observed that, already in one dimension, rulesets with three moves can be hard to analyze, and still today his related conjecture remains open. Here, we solve instances of rulesets with three moves in two dimensions, and conjecture that they all have regular outcomes. Through several computer visualizations of outcomes of multi-move two-dimensional rulesets, we observe that they tend to partition the game board into periodic mosaics on very few regions/segments, which can depend on the number of moves in a ruleset. For example, we have found a five-move ruleset with an outcome segmentation into six semi-infinite slices. In this spirit, we develop a coloring automaton that generalizes the \\P-to-\\P\\ principle. Given an initial set of colored positions, it quickly paints the \\P-positions in segments of the game board.

On relaxed controls, two studied topologies are the Young and Borkar (weak$^*$) topologies on spaces of functions from a state/measurement space to the space of probability measures on control action spaces; the former via a weak convergence topology on probability measures on a product space with a fixed marginal on the input (state) space, and the latter via a weak$^*$ topology on randomized policies viewed as maps from states/measurements to the space of signed measures with bounded variation. We establish implication and equivalence conditions between the Young and Borkar topologies on control policies. We then show that, under some conditions, for a controlled Markov chain with standard Borel spaces the invariant measure is weakly continuous on the space of stationary control policies defined by either of these topologies.

{"text": "Title: Fully Automated Image De-fencing using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks\nAbstract: Image de-fencing is one of the important aspects of recreational photography in which the objective is to remove the fence texture present in an image and generate an aesthetically pleasing version of the same image without the fence texture. In this paper, we aim to develop an automated and effective technique for fence removal and image reconstruction using conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs). These networks have been successfully applied in several domains of Computer Vision focusing on image generation and rendering. Our initial approach is based on a two-stage architecture involving two cGANs that generate the fence mask and the inpainted image, respectively. Training of these networks is carried out independently and, during evaluation, the input image is passed through the two generators in succession to obtain the de-fenced image. The results obtained from this approach are satisfactory, but the response time is long since the image has to pass through two sets of convolution layers. To reduce the response time, we propose a second approach involving only a single cGAN architecture that is trained using the ground-truth of fenced de-fenced image pairs along with the edge map of the fenced image produced by the Canny Filter. Incorporation of the edge map helps the network to precisely detect the edges present in the input image, and also imparts it an ability to carry out high quality de-fencing in an efficient manner, even in the presence of a fewer number of layers as compared to the two-stage network. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results reported in the manuscript reveal that the de-fenced images generated by the single-stage de-fencing network have similar visual quality to those produced by the two-stage network. Comparative performance analysis also emphasizes the effectiveness of our approach over state-of-the-art image de-fencing techniques.", "label": 1, "field": "cs"}

The network is composed of biologically plausible elements, and trained according to the unsupervised Hebbian learning rule, Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP). After training, the SNN can be used to generate low-dimensional spike-based text representation suitable for text/document classification.

{"text": "Title: The Gossiping Insert-Eliminate Algorithm for Multi-Agent Bandits\nAbstract: We consider a decentralized multi-agent Multi Armed Bandit (MAB) setup consisting of $N$ agents, solving the same MAB instance to minimize individual cumulative regret. In our model, agents collaborate by exchanging messages through pairwise gossip style communications on an arbitrary connected graph. We develop two novel algorithms, where each agent only plays from a subset of all the arms. Agents use the communication medium to recommend only arm-IDs (not samples), and thus update the set of arms from which they play. We establish that, if agents communicate $\\Omega(\\log(T))$ times through any connected pairwise gossip mechanism, then every agent's regret is a factor of order $N$ smaller compared to the case of no collaborations. Furthermore, we show that the communication constraints only have a second order effect on the regret of our algorithm. We then analyze this second order term of the regret to derive bounds on the regret-communication tradeoffs. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithm and conclude that the insights are fundamental and not artifacts of our bounds. We also show a lower bound which gives that the regret scaling obtained by our algorithm cannot be improved even in the absence of any communication constraints. Our results thus demonstrate that even a minimal level of collaboration among agents greatly reduces regret for all agents.", "label": 1, "field": "cs"}
{"text": "Title: Lightweight Fish Classification Model for Sustainable Marine Management: Indonesian Case\nAbstract: The enormous demand for seafood products has led to exploitation of marine resources and near-extinction of some species. In particular, overfishing is one the main issues in sustainable marine development. In alignment with the protection of marine resources and sustainable fishing, this study proposes to advance fish classification techniques that support identifying protected fish species using state-of-the-art machine learning. We use a custom modification of the MobileNet model to design a lightweight classifier called M-MobileNet that is capable of running on limited hardware. As part of the study, we compiled a labeled dataset of 37,462 images of fish found in the waters of the Indonesian archipelago. The proposed model is trained on the dataset to classify images of the captured fish into their species and give recommendations on whether they are consumable or not. Our modified MobileNet model uses only 50\\% of the top layer parameters with about 42% GTX 860M utility and achieves up to 97% accuracy in fish classification and determining its consumability. Given the limited computing capacity available on many fishing vessels, the proposed model provides a practical solution to on-site fish classification. In addition, synchronized implementation of the proposed model on multiple vessels can supply valuable information about the movement and location of different species of fish.", "label": 0, "field": "cs"}
{"text": "Title: CARAT: Contrastive Feature Reconstruction and Aggregation for Multi-modal Multi-label Emotion Recognition\nAbstract: Multi-modal multi-label emotion recognition (MMER) aims to identify relevant emotions from multiple modalities. The challenge of MMER is how to effectively capture discriminative features for multiple labels from heterogeneous data. Recent studies are mainly devoted to exploring various fusion strategies to integrate multi-modal information into a unified representation for all labels. However, such a learning scheme not only overlooks the specificity of each modality but also fails to capture individual discriminative features for different labels. Moreover, dependencies of labels and modalities cannot be effectively modeled. To address these issues, this paper presents ContrAstive feature Reconstruction and AggregaTion (CARAT) for the MMER task. Specifically, we devise a reconstruction-based fusion mechanism to better model fine-grained modality-to-label dependencies by contrastively learning modal-separated and label-specific features. To further exploit the modality complementarity, we introduce a shuffle-based aggregation strategy to enrich co-occurrence collaboration among labels. Experiments on two benchmark datasets CMU-MOSEI and M3ED demonstrate the effectiveness of CARAT over state-of-the-art methods.

{"text": "Title: Dynamic Service Placement for Mobile Micro-Clouds with Predicted Future Costs\nAbstract: Mobile micro-clouds are promising for enabling performance-critical cloud applications. However, one challenge therein is the dynamics at the network edge. In this paper, we study how to place service instances to cope with these dynamics, where multiple users and service instances coexist in the system. Our goal is to find the optimal placement (configuration) of instances to minimize the average cost over time, leveraging the ability of predicting future cost parameters with known accuracy. We first propose an offline algorithm that solves for the optimal configuration in a specific look-ahead time-window. Then, we propose an online approximation algorithm with polynomial time-complexity to find the placement in real-time whenever an instance arrives. We analytically show that the online algorithm is $O(1)$-competitive for a broad family of cost functions. Afterwards, the impact of prediction errors is considered and a method for finding the optimal look-ahead window size is proposed, which minimizes an upper bound of the average actual cost. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated by simulations with both synthetic and real-world (San Francisco taxi) user-mobility traces. The theoretical methodology used in this paper can potentially be applied to a larger class of dynamic resource allocation problems.", "label": 1, "field": "cs"}

If in addition $\\nabla$ has regular singularities, we call it a quasi-motivic pencil. We use tools from complex analysis to establish various remarkable properties of such pencils over $\\mathbb C$. For example, we show that the monodromy of a quasi-motivic pencil is defined over the field of algebraic functions in $e^{2\\pi is_j}$, and that its singularities are constrained to an arrangement of hyperplanes with integer normal vectors. Then we show that many important examples of families of flat connections, such as Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov, Dunkl, and Casimir connections, are quasi-motivic and thus periodic pencils. Besides being interesting in its own right, the periodic property of a pencil of flat connections turns out to be very useful in computing the eigenvalues of the $p$-curvature of its reduction to positive characteristic.

From a machine-learning perspective, leakages can be modeled as concept drift. Thus, a wide variety of drift detection schemes seems to be a suitable choice for detecting leakages. In this work, we explore the potential of model-loss-based and distribution-based drift detection methods to tackle leakage detection. We additionally discuss the issue of temporal dependencies in the data and propose a way to cope with it when applying distribution-based detection.

Our findings reveal that models can quickly regain performance post-pruning by relocating advanced concepts to earlier layers and reallocating pruned concepts to primed neurons with similar semantics. This demonstrates that models exhibit polysemantic capacities and can blend old and new concepts in individual neurons. While neuron pruning provides interpretability into model concepts, our results highlight the challenges of permanent concept removal for improved model \\textit{safety}.

This paper focuses on two model compression techniques: low-rank approximation and weight pruning in neural networks, which are very popular nowadays. However, training NN with low-rank approximation and weight pruning always suffers significant accuracy loss and convergence issues. In this paper, a holistic framework is proposed for model compression from a novel perspective of nonconvex optimization by designing an appropriate objective function. Then, we introduce NN-BCD, a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to solve the nonconvex optimization. One advantage of our algorithm is that an efficient iteration scheme can be derived with closed-form, which is gradient-free. Therefore, our algorithm will not suffer from vanishing/exploding gradient problems. Furthermore, with the Kurdyka-{\\L}ojasiewicz (K{\\L}) property of our objective function, we show that our algorithm globally converges to a critical point at the rate of O(1/k), where k denotes the number of iterations.

While executing sensing tasks, the user terminals can optionally offload sensing data to either MEC server or cloud servers. To minimize the execution latency, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming matrices and offloading decision variables under the constraint of sensing performance. An alternating optimization algorithm based on multidimensional fractional programming is proposed to tackle the non-convex problem. Simulation results demonstrates the superiority of the proposed mechanism in terms of convergence and task execution latency reduction, compared with the state-of-the-art two-tier ISCC framework.", "label": 0, "field": "cs"}
{"text": "Title: Bayesian Neural Network Versus Ex-Post Calibration For Prediction Uncertainty\nAbstract: Probabilistic predictions from neural networks which account for predictive uncertainty during classification is crucial in many real-world and high-impact decision making settings. However, in practice most datasets are trained on non-probabilistic neural networks which by default do not capture this inherent uncertainty. This well-known problem has led to the development of post-hoc calibration procedures, such as Platt scaling (logistic), isotonic and beta calibration, which transforms the scores into well calibrated empirical probabilities. A plausible alternative to the calibration approach is to use Bayesian neural networks, which directly models a predictive distribution. Although they have been applied to images and text datasets, they have seen limited adoption in the tabular and small data regime. In this paper, we demonstrate that Bayesian neural networks yields competitive performance when compared to calibrated neural networks and conduct experiments across a wide array of datasets.", "label": 1, "field": "cs"}

However, due to the high dimensionality of the genotypes for GP, the task of visualising the fitness landscape for GP search can be difficult.

This encoding permits easier visualisation of the fitness landscape arbitrary problems by providing a way to map fitness against a single dimension. The new framework also makes it trivially easy to apply continuous search algorithms, such as Differential Evolution, to the search problem.

{"text": "Title: Introducing an experimental distortion-tolerant speech encryption scheme for secure voice communication\nAbstract: The current increasing need for privacy-preserving voice communications is leading to new ideas for securing voice transmission. This paper refers to a relatively new concept of sending encrypted speech as pseudo-speech in the audio domain over digital voice communication infrastructures, like 3G cellular network and VoIP. This work presents a novel distortion-tolerant speech encryption scheme for secure voice communications over voice channels that combines the robustness of analog speech scrambling and elevated security offered by digital ciphers like AES-CTR. The system scrambles vocal parameters of a speech signal (loudness, pitch, timbre) using distance-preserving pseudo-random translations and rotations on a hypersphere of parameters. Next, scrambled parameters are encoded to a pseudo-speech signal adapted to transmission over digital voice channels equipped with voice activity detection. Upon reception of this pseudo-speech signal, the legitimate receiver restores distorted copies of the initial vocal parameters. Despite some deciphering errors, an integrated neural-based vocoder based on the LPCNet architecture reconstructs an intelligible speech. The experimental implementation of this speech encryption scheme has been tested by simulations and sending an encrypted signal over FaceTime between two iPhones 6 connected to the same WiFi network. Moreover, speech excerpts restored from encrypted signals were evaluated by a speech quality assessment on a group of about 40 participants. The experiments demonstrated that the proposed scheme produces intelligible speech with a gracefully progressive quality degradation depending on the channel noise. Finally, the preliminary computational analysis suggested that the presented setting may operate on high-end portable devices in nearly real-time.", "label": 1, "field": "cs"}

{"text": "Title: Chordal graphs, even-hole-free graphs and sparse obstructions to bounded treewidth\nAbstract: We present and study the following conjecture: for an integer $t\\geq 4$ and a graph $H$, every even-hole-free graph of large enough treewidth has an induced subgraph isomorphic to either $K_t$ or $H$, if (and only if) $H$ is a $K_4$-free chordal graph. The ``only if'' part follows from the properties of the so-called layered wheels due to Sintiari and Trotignon. Alecu, Chudnovsky, Spirkl and the author recently proved the conjecture in two special cases: (a) when $t=4$; and (b) when $H=cone (F)$ for some forest $F$; that is, $H$ is obtained from $F$ by adding a universal vertex. Our first result is a common strengthening: for an integer $t\\geq 4$ and graphs $F$ and $H$, (even-hole, $cone(cone (F))$, $H$, $K_t$)-free graphs have bounded treewidth if and only if $F$ is a forest and $H$ is a $K_4$-free chordal graph. For general $t\\geq 4$, we push the current state of the art further than (b) by settling the conjecture for the smallest choices of $H$ that are not coned forests. This follows from our second result: we prove the conjecture when $H$ is a crystal; that is, a graph obtained from several coned double stars by gluing them together along the middle edges of the double stars. We also propose another conjecture motivated by the following observation: except for complete graphs and complete bipartite graphs, all the constructions of graphs with unbounded treewidth which have been discovered so far are $2$-degenerate. Specifically, we conjecture that for every $t\\geq 1$, every graph of sufficiently large treewidth has an induced subgraph of treewidth $t$ which is either complete, complete bipartite, or $2$-degenerate. This conjecture is the first to predict a grid-type theorem for induced subgraphs, and what makes it even more relevant is somewhat serendipitous: if true, it would imply our former conjecture by reducing it to (a).", "label": 0, "field": "math"}

We then utilize Delaunay triangulation in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to ascertain the initial points for the construction of the maximal internal curve envelope by adopting a pseudo-recursive approach for higher-order void identification. In each iteration, the existing collection of maximal internal curve envelope points serves as a basis for identifying additional candidate points. This iterative process is inherently self-converging, ensuring progressive refinement of the void's shape with each successive computation cycle. The mathematical robustness of this method allows for an efficient convergence to a stable solution, reflecting both the geometric intricacies and the topological characteristics of the voids within the point cloud. Our findings introduce a method that aims to balance geometric accuracy with computational practicality.

First, the data-augmentation strategies (cropping, warping, etc.) distort the composition of a photograph and affect the performance. Secondly, the CNN features, in principle, are translation-invariant and appearance-dependent. But some geometric properties important for aesthetics, e.g. the Rule of Thirds (RoT), are position-dependent and appearance-invariant. Therefore, we propose a novel input representation which is geometry-sensitive, position-cognizant and appearance-invariant.

{"text": "Title: Kempe equivalence and quadratic toric rings\nAbstract: Perfectly contractile graphs form a typical class of perfect graphs. In particular, all $k$-colorings of a perfectly contractile graph are Kempe equivalent. Everett and Reed conjectured that a graph is perfectly contractile if and only if it contains no odd holes, no antiholes and no odd prisms. On the other hand the authors and Shibata conjectured that a perfect graph is perfectly contractile if and only if its toric ring, which is called the stable set ring, is quadratic. In the present paper, we characterize when the stable set ring of a (not necessarily perfect) graph is quadratic by using Kempe equivalence. As applications of this characterization, we can claim that if Everett and Reed conjecture is true, then the conjecture of the authors and Shibata is also true. Moreover, we can show that for several important classes of perfectly contractile graphs, the stable set rings are quadratic.", "label": 0, "field": "math"}

{"text": "Title: Path-based Explanation for Knowledge Graph Completion\nAbstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) by modelling how entities and relations interact in recent years. However, the explanation of the predicted facts has not caught the necessary attention. Proper explanations for the results of GNN-based KGC models increase model transparency and help researchers develop more reliable models. Existing practices for explaining KGC tasks rely on instance/subgraph-based approaches, while in some scenarios, paths can provide more user-friendly and interpretable explanations. Nonetheless, the methods for generating path-based explanations for KGs have not been well-explored. To address this gap, we propose Power-Link, the first path-based KGC explainer that explores GNN-based models. We design a novel simplified graph-powering technique, which enables the generation of path-based explanations with a fully parallelisable and memory-efficient training scheme.

Patterned textures inspection, particularly in the context of fabric defect detection, is indeed a widely encountered use case. This task involves handling a diverse spectrum of colors and textile types, encompassing a wide range of fabrics. Given the extensive variability in colors, textures, and defect types, fabric defect detection poses a complex and challenging problem in the field of patterned textures inspection. In this article, we propose a knowledge distillation-based approach tailored specifically for addressing the challenge of unsupervised anomaly detection in textures resembling fabrics. Our method aims to redefine the recently introduced reverse distillation approach, which advocates for an encoder-decoder design to mitigate classifier bias and to prevent the student from reconstructing anomalies. In this study, we present a new reverse distillation technique for the specific task of fabric defect detection. Our approach involves a meticulous design selection that strategically highlights high-level features. To demonstrate the capabilities of our approach both in terms of performance and inference speed, we conducted a series of experiments on multiple texture datasets, including MVTEC AD, AITEX, and TILDA, alongside conducting experiments on a dataset acquired from a textile manufacturing facility.

If the vector field of a TPDS is T-periodic then every bounded trajectory converges to a T-periodic solution. In particular, when the vector field is time-invariant every bounded trajectory of a TPDS converges to an equlbrium. Here, we use the spectral theory of oscillatory matrices to analyze the behavior near a periodic solution of a TPDS.

{"text": "Title: Mining Temporal Attack Patterns from Cyberthreat Intelligence Reports\nAbstract: Defending from cyberattacks requires practitioners to operate on high-level adversary behavior. Cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports on past cyberattack incidents describe the chain of malicious actions with respect to time. To avoid repeating cyberattack incidents, practitioners must proactively identify and defend against recurring chain of actions - which we refer to as temporal attack patterns. Automatically mining the patterns among actions provides structured and actionable information on the adversary behavior of past cyberattacks. The goal of this paper is to aid security practitioners in prioritizing and proactive defense against cyberattacks by mining temporal attack patterns from cyberthreat intelligence reports. To this end, we propose ChronoCTI, an automated pipeline for mining temporal attack patterns from cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports of past cyberattacks. To construct ChronoCTI, we build the ground truth dataset of temporal attack patterns and apply state-of-the-art large language models, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques. We apply ChronoCTI on a set of 713 CTI reports, where we identify 124 temporal attack patterns - which we categorize into nine pattern categories. We identify that the most prevalent pattern category is to trick victim users into executing malicious code to initiate the attack, followed by bypassing the anti-malware system in the victim network. Based on the observed patterns, we advocate organizations to train users about cybersecurity best practices, introduce immutable operating systems with limited functionalities, and enforce multi-user authentications. Moreover, we advocate practitioners to leverage the automated mining capability of ChronoCTI and design countermeasures against the recurring attack patterns.", "label": 0, "field": "cs"}
{"text": "Title: Existence of solutions to the nonlinear equations characterizing the precise error of M-estimators\nAbstract: Major progress has been made in the previous decade to characterize the asymptotic behavior of regularized M-estimators in high-dimensional regression problems in the proportional asymptotic regime where the sample size $n$ and the number of features $p$ are increasing simultaneously such that $n/p\\to \\delta \\in(0,\\infty)$, using powerful tools such as Approximate Message Passing or the Convex Gaussian Min-Max Theorem (CGMT). The asymptotic error and behavior of the regularized M-estimator is then typically described by a system of nonlinear equations with a few scalar unknowns, and the solution to this system precisely characterize the asymptotic error. Application of the CGMT and related machinery requires the existence of a solution to this low-dimensional system of equations. This paper resolves the question of existence of solution to this low-dimensional system for the case of linear models with independent additive noise, when both the data-fitting loss function and regularization penalty are separable and convex. Such existence result for solution to the nonlinear system were previously known under strong convexity for specific estimators such as the Lasso.

An optimal dynamic var source placement method addressing fault-induced delayed voltage recovery (FIDVR) issues is further formulated as an optimization problem that maximizes the determinant of ECC. The optimization problem is effectively solved by the NOMAD solver, which implements the Mesh Adaptive Direct Search algorithm. The proposed method is tested on an NPCC 140-bus system and the results show that the proposed method with fault specified ECC can solve the FIDVR issue caused by the most severe contingency with fewer dynamic var sources than the Voltage Sensitivity Index (VSI) based method. The proposed method with fault unspecified ECC does not depend on the settings of the contingency and can address more FIDVR issues than VSI method when placing the same number of SVCs under different fault durations.

An important ingredient in planar para algebra theory is the string Fourier transform (SFT), that we use on the matrix algebra generated by the Pauli matrices. Two different reflections play an important role in the theory of planar para algebras. One is the adjoint operator; the other is the modular conjugation in Tomita-Takesaki theory.

{"text": "Title: Accurate Leukocyte Detection Based on Deformable-DETR and Multi-Level Feature Fusion for Aiding Diagnosis of Blood Diseases\nAbstract: In standard hospital blood tests, the traditional process requires doctors to manually isolate leukocytes from microscopic images of patients' blood using microscopes. These isolated leukocytes are then categorized via automatic leukocyte classifiers to determine the proportion and volume of different types of leukocytes present in the blood samples, aiding disease diagnosis. This methodology is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive, but it also has a high propensity for errors due to factors such as image quality and environmental conditions, which could potentially lead to incorrect subsequent classifications and misdiagnosis. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative method of leukocyte detection: the Multi-level Feature Fusion and Deformable Self-attention DETR (MFDS-DETR). To tackle the issue of leukocyte scale disparity, we designed the High-level Screening-feature Fusion Pyramid (HS-FPN), enabling multi-level fusion. This model uses high-level features as weights to filter low-level feature information via a channel attention module and then merges the screened information with the high-level features, thus enhancing the model's feature expression capability. Further, we address the issue of leukocyte feature scarcity by incorporating a multi-scale deformable self-attention module in the encoder and using the self-attention and cross-deformable attention mechanisms in the decoder, which aids in the extraction of the global features of the leukocyte feature maps. The effectiveness, superiority, and generalizability of the proposed MFDS-DETR method are confirmed through comparisons with other cutting-edge leukocyte detection models using the private WBCDD, public LISC and BCCD datasets.

In order to model local amplitude and phase structure in images, we focus on the case of two dimensional subspaces, and the $L_2$-norm. When trained on natural images the model learns subspaces resembling quadrature-pair Gabor filters. We then introduce an additional set of hidden units that model the dependencies among subspace phases.

However, in tasks such as body pose and hand gesture translation, existing methods usually require precise annotations, e.g. key-points or skeletons, which are time-consuming to draw. In this work, we propose a novel GAN architecture that decouples the required annotations into a category label - that specifies the gesture type - and a simple-to-draw category-independent conditional map - that expresses the location, rotation and size of the hand gesture. Our architecture synthesizes the target gesture while preserving the background context, thus effectively dealing with gesture translation in the wild. To this aim, we use an attention module and a rolling guidance approach, which loops the generated images back into the network and produces higher quality images compared to competing works. Thus, our GAN learns to generate new images from simple annotations without requiring key-points or skeleton labels. Results on two public datasets show that our method outperforms state of the art approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.

By using the constant magnitude property of the entries of the measurement matrix in the massive MIMO-OFDM channel estimation and the asymptotic analysis, we find that the second-order natural parameters of the distributions on all the auxiliary manifolds are equivalent to each other at each iteration of IGA, and the first-order natural parameters of the distributions on all the auxiliary manifolds are asymptotically equivalent to each other at the fixed point of IGA. Motivated by these results, we simplify the iterative process of IGA and propose a simplified IGA for massive MIMO-OFDM channel estimation.

{"text": "Title: Significance of Anatomical Constraints in Virtual Try-On\nAbstract: The system of Virtual Try-ON (VTON) allows a user to try a product virtually. In general, a VTON system takes a clothing source and a person's image to predict the try-on output of the person in the given clothing. Although existing methods perform well for simple poses, in case of bent or crossed arms posture or when there is a significant difference between the alignment of the source clothing and the pose of the target person, these methods fail by generating inaccurate clothing deformations. In the VTON methods that employ Thin Plate Spline (TPS) based clothing transformations, this mainly occurs for two reasons - (1)~the second-order smoothness constraint of TPS that restricts the bending of the object plane. (2)~Overlaps among different clothing parts (e.g., sleeves and torso) can not be modeled by a single TPS transformation, as it assumes the clothing as a single planar object; therefore, disregards the independence of movement of different clothing parts. To this end, we make two major contributions. Concerning the bending limitations of TPS, we propose a human AnaTomy-Aware Geometric (ATAG) transformation. Regarding the overlap issue, we propose a part-based warping approach that divides the clothing into independently warpable parts to warp them separately and later combine them.

We investigate how the residual connections of WCRNNs influence their performance, network dynamics, and memory properties on a set of benchmark tasks. We show that several distinct forms of residual connections yield effective inductive biases that result in increased network expressivity. In particular, those are residual connections that (i) result in network dynamics at the proximity of the edge of chaos, (ii) allow networks to capitalize on characteristic spectral properties of the data, and (iii) result in heterogeneous memory properties. In addition, we demonstrate how our results can be extended to non-linear residuals and introduce a weakly coupled residual initialization scheme that can be used for Elman RNNs.", "label": 0, "field": "cs"}
{"text": "Title: $F$-finiteness of homomorphisms and its descent\nAbstract: Let $p$ be a prime number. We define the notion of $F$-finiteness of homomorphisms of $\\mathbb F_p$-algebras, and discuss some basic properties. In particular, we prove a sort of descent theorem on $F$-finiteness of homomorphisms of $\\mathbb F_p$-algebras. As a corollary, we prove the following. Let $g:B\\to C$ be a homomorphism of Noetherian $\\mathbb F_p$-algebras. If $g$ is faithfully flat reduced, and $C$ is $F$-finite, then $B$ is $F$-finite. This is a generalization of Seydi's result on excellent local rings of characteristic $p$.", "label": 1, "field": "math"}
{"text": "Title: Error Forward-Propagation: Reusing Feedforward Connections to Propagate Errors in Deep Learning\nAbstract: We introduce Error Forward-Propagation, a biologically plausible mechanism to propagate error feedback forward through the network. Architectural constraints on connectivity are virtually eliminated for error feedback in the brain; systematic backward connectivity is not used or needed to deliver error feedback. Feedback as a means of assigning credit to neurons earlier in the forward pathway for their contribution to the final output is thought to be used in learning in the brain. How the brain solves the credit assignment problem is unclear. In machine learning, error backpropagation is a highly successful mechanism for credit assignment in deep multilayered networks. Backpropagation requires symmetric reciprocal connectivity for every neuron. From a biological perspective, there is no evidence of such an architectural constraint, which makes backpropagation implausible for learning in the brain. This architectural constraint is reduced with the use of random feedback weights. Models using random feedback weights require backward connectivity patterns for every neuron, but avoid symmetric weights and reciprocal connections. In this paper, we practically remove this architectural constraint, requiring only a backward loop connection for effective error feedback. We propose reusing the forward connections to deliver the error feedback by feeding the outputs into the input receiving layer. This mechanism, Error Forward-Propagation, is a plausible basis for how error feedback occurs deep in the brain independent of and yet in support of the functionality underlying intricate network architectures. We show experimentally that recurrent neural networks with two and three hidden layers can be trained using Error Forward-Propagation on the MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, achieving $1.90\\%$ and $11\\%$ generalization errors respectively.", "label": 1, "field": "cs"}

{"text": "Title: Linked partition ideals, directed graphs and $q$-multi-summations\nAbstract: Finding an Andrews--Gordon type generating function identity for a linked partition ideal is difficult in most cases. In this paper, we will handle this problem in the setting of graph theory. With the generating function of directed graphs with an ``empty'' vertex, we then turn our attention to a $q$-difference system. This $q$-difference system eventually yields a factorization problem of a special type of column functional vectors involving $q$-multi-summations. Finally, using a recurrence relation satisfied by certain $q$-multi-summations, we are able to provide non-computer-assisted proofs of some Andrews--Gordon type generating function identities. These proofs also have an interesting connection with binary trees.", "label": 1, "field": "math"}

{"text": "Title: A parametricity-based formalization of semi-simplicial and semi-cubical sets\nAbstract: Semi-simplicial and semi-cubical sets are commonly defined as presheaves over respectively, the semi-simplex or semi-cube category. Homotopy Type Theory then popularized an alternative definition, where the set of n-simplices or n-cubes are instead regrouped into the families of the fibers over their faces, leading to a characterization we call indexed. Moreover, it is known that semi-simplicial and semi-cubical sets are related to iterated Reynolds parametricity, respectively in its unary and binary variants. We exploit this correspondence to develop an original uniform indexed definition of both augmented semi-simplicial and semi-cubical sets, and fully formalize it in Coq.", "label": 0, "field": "cs"}

We obtain a sufficient condition on $W$ which when satisfied gives an affirmative answer to our question. More precisely, we show the intersection is non-empty for any such $W$ that admits at most one non-normal crossing type discriminant point associated with some proper projection.

For finite abelian groups this is equivalent with other relevant properities of the action.", "label": 0, "field": "math"}
