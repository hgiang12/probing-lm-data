We focus on following complex instructions that are more akin to natural conversation than traditional explicit procedural directives typically seen in robotics. Unlike most prior work where navigation directives are provided as simple imperative commands (e.g., \"go to the fridge\"), we examine implicit directives obtained through conversational interactions.We leverage the 3D simulator AI2Thor to create household query scenarios at scale, and augment it by adding complex language queries for 40 object types.

{"text": "Title: SugarViT -- Multi-objective Regression of UAV Images with Vision Transformers and Deep Label Distribution Learning Demonstrated on Disease Severity Prediction in Sugar Beet\nAbstract: Remote sensing and artificial intelligence are pivotal technologies of precision agriculture nowadays. The efficient retrieval of large-scale field imagery combined with machine learning techniques shows success in various tasks like phenotyping, weeding, cropping, and disease control. This work will introduce a machine learning framework for automatized large-scale plant-specific trait annotation for the use case disease severity scoring for Cercospora Leaf Spot (CLS) in sugar beet. With concepts of Deep Label Distribution Learning (DLDL), special loss functions, and a tailored model architecture, we develop an efficient Vision Transformer based model for disease severity scoring called SugarViT. One novelty in this work is the combination of remote sensing data with environmental parameters of the experimental sites for disease severity prediction. Although the model is evaluated on this special use case, it is held as generic as possible to also be applicable to various image-based classification and regression tasks. With our framework, it is even possible to learn models on multi-objective problems as we show by a pretraining on environmental metadata.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Multi-scale Traffic Pattern Bank for Cross-city Few-shot Traffic Forecasting\nAbstract: Traffic forecasting is crucial for intelligent transportation systems (ITS), aiding in efficient resource allocation and effective traffic control. However, its effectiveness often relies heavily on abundant traffic data, while many cities lack sufficient data due to limited device support, posing a significant challenge for traffic forecasting. Recognizing this challenge, we have made a noteworthy observation: traffic patterns exhibit similarities across diverse cities. Building on this key insight, we propose a solution for the cross-city few-shot traffic forecasting problem called Multi-scale Traffic Pattern Bank (MTPB). Primarily, MTPB initiates its learning process by leveraging data-rich source cities, effectively acquiring comprehensive traffic knowledge through a spatial-temporal-aware pre-training process. Subsequently, the framework employs advanced clustering techniques to systematically generate a multi-scale traffic pattern bank derived from the learned knowledge. Next, the traffic data of the data-scarce target city could query the traffic pattern bank, facilitating the aggregation of meta-knowledge. This meta-knowledge, in turn, assumes a pivotal role as a robust guide in subsequent processes involving graph reconstruction and forecasting. Empirical assessments conducted on real-world traffic datasets affirm the superior performance of MTPB, surpassing existing methods across various categories and exhibiting numerous attributes conducive to the advancement of cross-city few-shot forecasting methodologies.

{"text": "Title: AoII-Optimum Sampling of CTMC Information Sources Under Sampling Rate Constraints\nAbstract: We consider a sensor that samples an $N$-state continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC)-based information source process, and transmits the observed state of the source, to a remote monitor tasked with timely tracking of the source process. The mismatch between the source and monitor processes is quantified by age of incorrect information (AoII), which penalizes the mismatch as it stays longer, and our objective is to minimize the average AoII under an average sampling rate constraint. We assume a perfect reverse channel and hence the sensor has information of the estimate while initiating a transmission or preempting an ongoing transmission. First, by modeling the problem as an average cost constrained semi-Markov decision process (CSMDP), we show that the structure of the problem gives rise to an optimum threshold policy for which the sensor initiates a transmission once the AoII exceeds a threshold depending on the instantaneous values of both the source and monitor processes. However, due to the high complexity of obtaining the optimum policy in this general setting, we consider a relaxed problem where the thresholds are allowed to be dependent only on the estimate. We show that this relaxed problem can be solved with a novel CSMDP formulation based on the theory of absorbing MCs, with a computational complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N^4)$, allowing one to obtain optimum policies for general CTMCs with over a hundred states.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

This paper serves as a bridge, addressing the gap by providing a unifying framework of machine unlearning for image-to-image generative models.

{"text": "Title: Benefits of Transformer: In-Context Learning in Linear Regression Tasks with Unstructured Data\nAbstract: In practice, it is observed that transformer-based models can learn concepts in context in the inference stage. While existing literature, e.g., \\citet{zhang2023trained,huang2023context}, provide theoretical explanations on this in-context learning ability, they assume the input $x_i$ and the output $y_i$ for each sample are embedded in the same token (i.e., structured data). However, in reality, they are presented in two tokens (i.e., unstructured data \\cite{wibisono2023role}). In this case, this paper conducts experiments in linear regression tasks to study the benefits of the architecture of transformers and provides some corresponding theoretical intuitions to explain why the transformer can learn from unstructured data. We study the exact components in a transformer that facilitate the in-context learning. In particular, we observe that (1) a transformer with two layers of softmax (self-)attentions with look-ahead attention mask can learn from the prompt if $y_i$ is in the token next to $x_i$ for each example; (2) positional encoding can further improve the performance; and (3) multi-head attention with a high input embedding dimension has a better prediction performance than single-head attention.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Evolutionary Tabletop Game Design: A Case Study in the Risk Game\nAbstract: Creating and evaluating games manually is an arduous and laborious task. Procedural content generation can aid by creating game artifacts, but usually not an entire game. Evolutionary game design, which combines evolutionary algorithms with automated playtesting, has been used to create novel board games with simple equipment; however, the original approach does not include complex tabletop games with dice, cards, and maps. This work proposes an extension of the approach for tabletop games, evaluating the process by generating variants of Risk, a military strategy game where players must conquer map territories to win. We achieved this using a genetic algorithm to evolve the chosen parameters, as well as a rules-based agent to test the games and a variety of quality criteria to evaluate the new variations generated. Our results show the creation of new variations of the original game with smaller maps, resulting in shorter matches. Also, the variants produce more balanced matches, maintaining the usual drama. We also identified limitations in the process, where, in many cases, where the objective function was correctly pursued, but the generated games were nearly trivial.

Time-uniform LSI are obtained in two cases, either with the bounded-Lipschitz perturbation argument with respect to a reference measure, or with a coupling approach at high temperature. These arguments are then applied to mean-field equations, where, on the one hand, sharp marginal propagation of chaos estimates are obtained in smooth cases and, on the other hand, time-uniform global propagation of chaos is shown in the case of vortex interactions with quadratic confinement potential on the whole space.

{"text": "Title: ALISON: Fast and Effective Stylometric Authorship Obfuscation\nAbstract: Authorship Attribution (AA) and Authorship Obfuscation (AO) are two competing tasks of increasing importance in privacy research. Modern AA leverages an author's consistent writing style to match a text to its author using an AA classifier. AO is the corresponding adversarial task, aiming to modify a text in such a way that its semantics are preserved, yet an AA model cannot correctly infer its authorship. To address privacy concerns raised by state-of-the-art (SOTA) AA methods, new AO methods have been proposed but remain largely impractical to use due to their prohibitively slow training and obfuscation speed, often taking hours. To this challenge, we propose a practical AO method, ALISON, that (1) dramatically reduces training/obfuscation time, demonstrating more than 10x faster obfuscation than SOTA AO methods, (2) achieves better obfuscation success through attacking three transformer-based AA methods on two benchmark datasets, typically performing 15% better than competing methods, (3) does not require direct signals from a target AA classifier during obfuscation, and (4) utilizes unique stylometric features, allowing sound model interpretation for explainable obfuscation. We also demonstrate that ALISON can effectively prevent four SOTA AA methods from accurately determining the authorship of ChatGPT-generated texts, all while minimally changing the original text semantics.

{"text": "Title: Control-Theoretic Techniques for Online Adaptation of Deep Neural Networks in Dynamical Systems\nAbstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs), trained with gradient-based optimization and backpropagation, are currently the primary tool in modern artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. In many applications, DNNs are trained offline, through supervised learning or reinforcement learning, and deployed online for inference. However, training DNNs with standard backpropagation and gradient-based optimization gives no intrinsic performance guarantees or bounds on the DNN, which is essential for applications such as controls. Additionally, many offline-training and online-inference problems, such as sim2real transfer of reinforcement learning policies, experience domain shift from the training distribution to the real-world distribution. To address these stability and transfer learning issues, we propose using techniques from control theory to update DNN parameters online. We formulate the fully-connected feedforward DNN as a continuous-time dynamical system, and we propose novel last-layer update laws that guarantee desirable error convergence under various conditions on the time derivative of the DNN input vector. We further show that training the DNN under spectral normalization controls the upper bound of the error trajectories of the online DNN predictions, which is desirable when numerically differentiated quantities or noisy state measurements are input to the DNN. The proposed online DNN adaptation laws are validated in simulation to learn the dynamics of the Van der Pol system under domain shift, where parameters are varied in inference from the training dataset. The simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of using control-theoretic techniques to derive performance improvements and guarantees in DNN-based learning systems.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

This emphasizes the importance of analyzing and understanding their impacts on the system and users' choices, especially when integrated into a complex multi-modal system, including public transport (PT). Many studies overlook the synergies between SMSs and PT, leading to inaccurate traffic estimations and planning. This research offers an exhaustive review of multi-modal transportation system models involving SMSs. We then introduce a traffic assignment analytical model framed as a Mixed-Integer Quadratic Problem (MIQP). This model comprises diverse travel possibilities, including SMSs, and handles intermodality by allowing commuters to combine modes to optimize time and monetary expense. An in-depth examination of commuters' behavior on two test cases and an analysis of the price of anarchy highlights the disparities between user equilibrium and system optimum in such intricate systems.", "field": "math", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: A Theoretical Analysis of Noise Geometry in Stochastic Gradient Descent\nAbstract: In this paper, we provide a theoretical study of noise geometry for minibatch stochastic gradient descent (SGD), a phenomenon where noise aligns favorably with the geometry of local landscape. We propose two metrics, derived from analyzing how noise influences the loss and subspace projection dynamics, to quantify the alignment strength. We show that for (over-parameterized) linear models and two-layer nonlinear networks, when measured by these metrics, the alignment can be provably guaranteed under conditions independent of the degree of over-parameterization. To showcase the utility of our noise geometry characterizations, we present a refined analysis of the mechanism by which SGD escapes from sharp minima. We reveal that unlike gradient descent (GD), which escapes along the sharpest directions, SGD tends to escape from flatter directions and cyclical learning rates can exploit this SGD characteristic to navigate more effectively towards flatter regions. Lastly, extensive experiments are provided to support our theoretical findings.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

The problem is interesting not only from a graph coloring point of view, but is also closely related to the Degree Bounded Spanning Tree and (1,2)-Traveling Salesman problems, two classical questions that have attracted considerable interest in combinatorial optimization and approximation theory. Previous work on properly colored spanning trees has mainly focused on determining the existence of such a tree and hence has not considered the question from an algorithmic perspective. We propose an optimization version called Maximum-size Properly Colored Forest problem, which aims to find a properly colored forest with as many edges as possible. We consider the problem in different graph classes and for different numbers of colors, and present polynomial-time approximation algorithms as well as inapproximability results for these settings. Our proof technique relies on the sum of matching matroids defined by the color classes, a connection that might be of independent combinatorial interest. We also consider the Maximum-size Properly Colored Tree problem, which asks for the maximum size of a properly colored tree not necessarily spanning all the vertices. We show that the optimum is significantly more difficult to approximate than in the forest case, and provide an approximation algorithm for complete multigraphs.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

In this paper we propose two novel types of convolutions, dubbed \\emph{Pixel Difference Convolution (PDC) and Binary PDC (Bi-PDC)} which enjoy the following benefits: capturing higher-order local differential information, computationally efficient, and able to be integrated with existing DNNs. With PDC and Bi-PDC, we further present two lightweight deep networks named \\emph{Pixel Difference Networks (PiDiNet)} and \\emph{Binary PiDiNet (Bi-PiDiNet)} respectively to learn highly efficient yet more accurate representations for visual tasks including edge detection and object recognition.

The causal relations in a dynamic structural causal model can be qualitatively represented with an acyclic full-time causal graph. Assuming linearity and no hidden confounding and given the full-time causal graph, the direct causal effect is always identifiable. However, in many application such a graph is not available for various reasons but nevertheless experts have access to the summary causal graph of the full-time causal graph which represents causal relations between time series while omitting temporal information and allowing cycles.

{"text": "Title: Auction-Based Scheduling\nAbstract: Many sequential decision-making tasks require satisfaction of multiple, partially contradictory objectives. Existing approaches are monolithic, namely all objectives are fulfilled using a single policy, which is a function that selects a sequence of actions. We present auction-based scheduling, a modular framework for multi-objective decision-making problems. Each objective is fulfilled using a separate policy, and the policies can be independently created, modified, and replaced. Understandably, different policies with conflicting goals may choose conflicting actions at a given time. In order to resolve conflicts, and compose policies, we employ a novel auction-based mechanism. We allocate a bounded budget to each policy, and at each step, the policies simultaneously bid from their available budgets for the privilege of being scheduled and choosing an action. Policies express their scheduling urgency using their bids and the bounded budgets ensure long-run scheduling fairness. We lay the foundations of auction-based scheduling using path planning problems on finite graphs with two temporal objectives. We present decentralized algorithms to synthesize a pair of policies, their initially allocated budgets, and bidding strategies. We consider three categories of decentralized synthesis problems, parameterized by the assumptions that the policies make on each other: (a) strong synthesis, with no assumptions and strongest guarantees, (b) assume-admissible synthesis, with weakest rationality assumptions, and (c) assume-guarantee synthesis, with explicit contract-based assumptions. For reachability objectives, we show that, surprisingly, decentralized assume-admissible synthesis is always possible when the out-degrees of all vertices are at most two.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

To investigate the impact of different missingness patterns on link prediction accuracy, we employ 9 link prediction algorithms from 4 different families to analyze 20 different missingness functions categorized into 5 groups.

However, how to solve the RLD problem with provably near-optimal performance still remains an open problem. This paper presents a learning-based solution to this challenge. We first design a data-driven formulation for the RLD problem, which aims to construct a decision rule that directly maps day-ahead observable information to cost-effective dispatch decisions for the future delivery interval. Unlike most existing works that follow a predict-then-optimize paradigm, this end-to-end rule bypasses the additional suboptimality introduced by separately handling prediction and optimization. We then propose neural RLD, a novel solution method to the data-driven formulation. This method leverages an L2-regularized neural network to learn the decision rule, thereby transforming the data-driven formulation into a neural network training task that can be efficiently completed by stochastic gradient descent. A theoretical performance guarantee is further established to bound the suboptimality of our method, which implies that its suboptimality approaches to zero with high probability as more samples are utilized.

{"text": "Title: Tiered approach for rapid damage characterisation of infrastructure enabled by remote sensing and deep learning technologies\nAbstract: Critical infrastructure such as bridges are systematically targeted during wars and conflicts. This is because critical infrastructure is vital for enabling connectivity and transportation of people and goods, and hence, underpinning the national and international defence planning and economic growth. Mass destruction of bridges, along with minimal or no accessibility to these assets during natural and anthropogenic disasters, prevents us from delivering rapid recovery. As a result, systemic resilience is drastically reduced. A solution to this challenge is to use technology for stand-off observations. Yet, no method exists to characterise damage at different scales, i.e. regional, asset, and structural (component), and more so there is little or no systematic correlation between assessments at scale. We propose an integrated three-level tiered approach to fill this capability gap, and we demonstrate the methods for damage characterisation enabled by fit-for-purpose digital technologies. Next, this method is applied and validated to a case study in Ukraine that includes 17 bridges. From macro to micro, we deploy technology at scale, from Sentinel-1 SAR images, crowdsourced information, and high-resolution images to deep learning for damaged infrastructure. For the first time, the interferometric coherence difference and semantic segmentation of images were deployed to improve the reliability of damage characterisations from regional to infrastructure component level, when enhanced assessment accuracy is required.

We prove that if $V$ satisfies that the scalar curvature is non-negative and isoperimetric constant is no less than that of Euclidean space, then $V$ is flat. We also obtain that if the Perelman's local $\\nu$-entropy is non-negative for $V$ , then $V$ must be flat. As a corollory, we can improve a rigidity result obtained by Bakry, Concordet and Ledoux \\cite{BCL} and Ni\\cite{Ni2}, and show that if $V$ has the non-negative scalar curvature and the $L^2$-logarithmic Sobolev inequality with the best constant of Euclidean space, then $V$ must be flat.", "field": "math", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: 360-GS: Layout-guided Panoramic Gaussian Splatting For Indoor Roaming\nAbstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has recently attracted great attention with real-time and photo-realistic renderings. This technique typically takes perspective images as input and optimizes a set of 3D elliptical Gaussians by splatting them onto the image planes, resulting in 2D Gaussians. However, applying 3D-GS to panoramic inputs presents challenges in effectively modeling the projection onto the spherical surface of ${360^\\circ}$ images using 2D Gaussians. In practical applications, input panoramas are often sparse, leading to unreliable initialization of 3D Gaussians and subsequent degradation of 3D-GS quality. In addition, due to the under-constrained geometry of texture-less planes (e.g., walls and floors), 3D-GS struggles to model these flat regions with elliptical Gaussians, resulting in significant floaters in novel views. To address these issues, we propose 360-GS, a novel $360^{\\circ}$ Gaussian splatting for a limited set of panoramic inputs. Instead of splatting 3D Gaussians directly onto the spherical surface, 360-GS projects them onto the tangent plane of the unit sphere and then maps them to the spherical projections. This adaptation enables the representation of the projection using Gaussians. We guide the optimization of 360-GS by exploiting layout priors within panoramas, which are simple to obtain and contain strong structural information about the indoor scene. Our experimental results demonstrate that 360-GS allows panoramic rendering and outperforms state-of-the-art methods with fewer artifacts in novel view synthesis, thus providing immersive roaming in indoor scenarios.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Producers Equilibria and Dynamics in Engagement-Driven Recommender Systems\nAbstract: Online platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, TikTok heavily rely on recommender systems to decide what content to show to which users.

To do so, producers try to align their content with the preferences of their targeted user base. In this work, we explore the equilibrium behavior of producers that are interested in maximizing user engagement. We study two variants of the content-serving rule that the platform's recommender system uses, and we show structural results on producers' production at equilibrium. We leverage these structural results to show that, in simple settings, we see specialization naturally arising from the competition among producers trying to maximize user engagement. We provide a heuristic for computing equilibria of our engagement game, and evaluate it experimentally.

{"text": "Title: ReAGent: Towards A Model-agnostic Feature Attribution Method for Generative Language Models\nAbstract: Feature attribution methods (FAs), such as gradients and attention, are widely employed approaches to derive the importance of all input features to the model predictions. Existing work in natural language processing has mostly focused on developing and testing FAs for encoder-only language models (LMs) in classification tasks. However, it is unknown if it is faithful to use these FAs for decoder-only models on text generation, due to the inherent differences between model architectures and task settings respectively. Moreover, previous work has demonstrated that there is no `one-wins-all' FA across models and tasks. This makes the selection of a FA computationally expensive for large LMs since input importance derivation often requires multiple forward and backward passes including gradient computations that might be prohibitive even with access to large compute. To address these issues, we present a model-agnostic FA for generative LMs called Recursive Attribution Generator (ReAGent). Our method updates the token importance distribution in a recursive manner. For each update, we compute the difference in the probability distribution over the vocabulary for predicting the next token between using the original input and using a modified version where a part of the input is replaced with RoBERTa predictions. Our intuition is that replacing an important token in the context should have resulted in a larger change in the model's confidence in predicting the token than replacing an unimportant token. Our method can be universally applied to any generative LM without accessing internal model weights or additional training and fine-tuning, as most other FAs require. We extensively compare the faithfulness of ReAGent with seven popular FAs across six decoder-only LMs of various sizes. The results show that our method consistently provides more faithful token importance distributions.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

We successfully achieved a reduction in the number of model parameters within published ML architectures from 202 million down to 2 million. This reduced the total size of the model parameters from 791 MB down to 8 MB. Additionally, this decreased the training time by a factor of four, the amount of graphics processing unit (GPU) memory needed for training by a factor of twenty, and the overall accuracy was increased from 80.16% to 82.54%.

{"text": "Title: 3D Beamforming Through Joint Phase-Time Arrays\nAbstract: High-frequency wideband cellular communications over mmWave and sub-THz offer the opportunity for high data rates. However, it also presents high path loss, resulting in limited coverage. High-gain beamforming brought by the antenna array is essential to mitigate the coverage limitations. The conventional phased antenna arrays (PAA) cause high scheduling latency owing to analog beam constraints, i.e., only one frequency-flat beam is generated. Recently introduced joint phase-time array (JPTA) architecture, which utilizes both true-time-delay (TTD) units and phase shifters (PSs), alleviates analog beam constraints by creating multiple frequency-dependent beams for scheduling multiple users at different directions in a frequency-division manner. One class of previous studies offered solutions with \"rainbow\" beams, which tend to allocate a small bandwidth per beam direction. Another class focused on uniform linear array (ULA) antenna architecture, whose frequency-dependent beams were designed along a single axis of either azimuth or elevation direction. This paper presents a novel 3D beamforming design that maximizes beamforming gain toward desired azimuth and elevation directions and across sub-bands partitioned according to scheduled users' bandwidth requirements. We provide analytical solutions and iterative algorithms to design the PSs and TTD units for a desired subband beam pattern.

With respect to objective (1), we provide new direct definitions of the cohomology group operations and of the cup product, which, just as in (Brunerie et al., 2022), enable significant simplifications of many earlier proofs in synthetic cohomology theory. In particular, the new definition of the cup product allows us to give the first complete formalisation of the axioms needed to turn the cohomology groups into a graded commutative ring. We also establish that this cohomology theory satisfies the HoTT formulation of the Eilenberg-Steenrod axioms for cohomology and study the classical Mayer-Vietoris and Gysin sequences. With respect to objective (2), we characterise the cohomology groups and rings of various spaces, including the spheres, torus, Klein bottle, real/complex projective planes, and infinite real projective space. All results have been formalised in Cubical Agda and we obtain multiple new numbers, similar to the famous `Brunerie number', which can be used as benchmarks for computational implementations of HoTT.

We thereby deduce optimal rates of convergence of the error with respect to the mesh-size for solutions with sufficient regularity. We further show full asymptotic quasi-optimality of the approximation error in the more restricted case of sequences of strictly acute meshes.

Existing methods have primarily focused on seeking a static optimal solution within the original model parameter space. A notable challenge is mitigating the interference between parameters of different models, which can substantially deteriorate performance.

We conducted quantitative (n=70) and qualitative (n=30) studies with healthcare experts to explore the impact of different explanations on trust, understandability and model improvement. Our results reveal the insufficiency of global model-centric explanations for guiding users during data configuration. Although data-centric explanations enhanced understanding of post-configuration system changes, a hybrid fusion of both explanation types demonstrated the highest effectiveness. Based on our study results, we also present design implications for effective explanation-driven interactive machine-learning systems.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Estimating Diffusion Degree on Graph Streams\nAbstract: The challenges of graph stream algorithms are twofold. First, each edge needs to be processed only once, and second, it needs to work on highly constrained memory. Diffusion degree is a measure of node centrality that can be calculated (for all nodes) trivially for static graphs using a single Breadth-First Search (BFS). However, keeping track of the Diffusion Degree in a graph stream is nontrivial. The memory requirement for exact calculation is equivalent to keeping the whole graph in memory. The present paper proposes an estimator (or sketch) of diffusion degree for graph streams. We prove the correctness of the proposed sketch and the upper bound of the estimated error. Given $\\epsilon, \\delta \\in (0,1)$, we achieve error below $\\epsilon(b_u-a_u)d_u\\lambda$ in node $u$ with probability $1-\\delta$ by utilizing $O(n\\frac1{\\epsilon^2}\\log{\\frac1{\\delta}})$ space, where $b_u$ and $a_u$ are the maximum and minimum degrees of neighbors of $u$, $\\lambda$ is diffusion probability, and $d_u$ is the degree of node $u$. With the help of this sketch, we propose an algorithm to extract the top-$k$ influencing nodes in the graph stream. Comparative experiments show that the spread of top-$k$ nodes by the proposed graph stream algorithm is equivalent to or better than the spread of top-$k$ nodes extracted by the exact algorithm.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

Due to the presence of small divisors, the proof is based on a nonlinear Nash-Moser scheme adapted to construct nonlinear waves of large amplitude. The main difficulty is that the linearized equation at any approximate solution is an unbounded perturbation of large size of a diagonal operator and hence the problem is not perturbative. The invertibility of the linearized operator is then performed by using tools from micro-local analysis and normal forms together with a sharp analysis of high and low frequency regimes w.r. to the large parameter $\\lambda \\gg 1$.

Next, we demonstrate the paradoxical nature of NGDM solutions for $L_{1}$-regularized problems, showing that increasing the regularization penalty leads to an increase in the $L_{1}$ norm of optimal solutions in NGDMs. Consequently, we show that widely adopted $L_{1}$ penalization-based techniques for network pruning do not yield expected results. Finally, we explore the Edge of Stability phenomenon, indicating its inapplicability even to Lipschitz continuous convex differentiable functions, leaving its relevance to non-convex non-differentiable neural networks inconclusive.

{"text": "Title: Triangle-free $2$-matchings\nAbstract: We consider the problem of finding a maximum size triangle-free $2$-matching in a graph $G$. A $2$-matching is any subset of the edges such that each vertex is incident to at most two edges from the subset. We present a fast combinatorial algorithm for the problem. Our algorithm and its analysis are dramatically simpler than the very complicated result by Hartvigsen from 1984. In the design of this algorithm we use several new concepts. It has been proven before that for any triangle-free $2$-matching $M$ which is not maximum the graph contains an $M$-augmenting path, whose application to $M$ results in a bigger triangle-free $2$-matching. It was not known how to efficiently find such a path. A new observation is that the search for an augmenting path $P$ can be restricted to so-called {\\em amenable} paths that go through any triangle $t$ contained in $P \\cup M$ a limited number of times. To find an augmenting path that is amenable and hence whose application does not create any triangle we forbid some edges to be followed by certain others. This operation can be thought of as using gadgets, in which some pairs of edges get disconnected. To be able to disconnect two edges we employ {\\em half-edges}. A {\\em half-edge} of edge $e$ is, informally speaking, a half of $e$ containing exactly one of its endpoints. This is another novel application of half-edges which were previously used for TSP and other matching problems. Additionally, gadgets are not fixed during any augmentation phase, but are dynamically changing according to the currently discovered state of reachability by amenable paths.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

Solution methods therefore require the integration of appropriate prior information. Early approaches rely on hand-crafted priors for the original image and the kernel. Recently, deep learning methods have shown excellent performance in addressing this challenge.

Substantial efforts are being made to improve the reliability and faithfulness of the generated rationales.

Subsequently, scene editing and collision detection can be performed, proving vital to a multitude of applications, such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), game/movie production, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to achieve object segmentation in 3D Gaussian via an interactive procedure without any training process and learned parameters. We refer to the proposed method as SA-GS, for Segment Anything in 3D Gaussians. Given a set of clicked points in a single input view, SA-GS can generalize SAM to achieve 3D consistent segmentation via the proposed multi-view mask generation and view-wise label assignment methods. We also propose a cross-view label-voting approach to assign labels from different views. In addition, in order to address the boundary roughness issue of segmented objects resulting from the non-negligible spatial sizes of 3D Gaussian located at the boundary, SA-GS incorporates the simple but effective Gaussian Decomposition scheme. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA-GS achieves high-quality 3D segmentation results, which can also be easily applied for scene editing and collision detection tasks.

Thus, our results show that many natural moduli stacks hold objects that are obstructed from being defined over their fields of moduli in every possible way, and have coarse spaces which fail to be fine moduli spaces in every possible way.

This find provides a way to induce a mutation sequence in a sub-cluster algebra from that in the cluster algebra in totally sign-skew-symmetric case analogous to that achieved via cluster scattering diagram in skew-symmetrizable case by [GHKK] and [M]. With this, we are able to generalize compatibility degree in [CL] and then obtain an equivalent condition of compatibility which does not rely on clusters and thus can be generalized for all polytope functions. Therefore, we could regard compatibility as an intrinsic property of variables, which explains the unistructurality of cluster algebras. According to such cluster structure of polytope functions, we construct a fan $\\mathcal{C}$ containing all cones in the $g$-fan. On the other hand, we also find a realization of $G$-matrices and $C$-matrices in polytopes by the mutation behaviors of polytopes, which helps to generalize the dualities between $G$-matrices and $C$-matrices introduced in [NZ] and leads to another polytope explanation of cluster structures. This allows us to construct another fan $\\mathcal{N}$ which also contains all cones in the $g$-fan.", "field": "math", "label": 1}

However, DT generates actions conditioned on a desired future return, which is known to bear some weaknesses such as the susceptibility to environmental stochasticity. To overcome DT's weaknesses, we propose to empower DT with dynamic programming. Our method comprises three steps. First, we employ in-sample value iteration to obtain approximated value functions, which involves dynamic programming over the MDP structure. Second, we evaluate action quality in context with estimated advantages. We introduce two types of advantage estimators, IAE and GAE, which are suitable for different tasks. Third, we train an Advantage-Conditioned Transformer (ACT) to generate actions conditioned on the estimated advantages. Finally, during testing, ACT generates actions conditioned on a desired advantage. Our evaluation results validate that, by leveraging the power of dynamic programming, ACT demonstrates effective trajectory stitching and robust action generation in spite of the environmental stochasticity, outperforming baseline methods across various benchmarks.

Such a problem is formulated into a nonconvex optimization problem, with the objective of maximizing a weighted sum of communication users' rates and the passive radar's signal-to-clutter-and-noise-ratio (SCNR). By exploring a low-dimensional subspace property of the optimal precoder, a low-complexity block-coordinate-descent (BCD)-based algorithm is proposed. Our analysis reveals that the hybrid analog/digital beamforming structure can attain the same performance as that of a fully digital precoder, provided that the number of radio frequency (RF) chains is no less than the number of resolvable signal paths. Also, through expressing the precoder as a sum of a communication-precoder and a sensing-precoder, we develop an analytical solution to the joint transceiver design problem by generalizing the idea of block-diagonalization (BD) to the ISAC system. Simulation results show that with a proper tradeoff parameter, the proposed methods can achieve a decent compromise between communication and sensing, where the performance of each communication/sensing task experiences only a mild performance loss as compared with the performance attained by optimizing exclusively for a single task.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

The result, non-exchangeable conformal nucleus sampling, is a novel extension of the conformal prediction framework to generation based on nearest neighbors. Our method can be used post-hoc for an arbitrary model without extra training and supplies token-level, calibrated prediction sets equipped with statistical guarantees.

Indeed, our method, given an image, make use of the strong language capabilities of models like GPT-4V by simply prompting them to recommend a typographic attack. Using our novel benchmark, we uncover that typographic attacks represent a significant threat against LVLM(s).

Knowing which places and transitions could be executed in parallel helps to understand nets and enables analysis techniques and the computation of other properties, such as causality, exclusivity, etc.. All techniques based on concurrency detection depend on the efficiency of this detection methodology. Kovalyov and Esparza have developed algorithms that compute all concurrent places in $O\\big((P+T)TP^2\\big)$ for live nets (where $P$ and $T$ are the numbers of places and transitions) and in $O\\big(P(P+T)^2\\big)$ for live free-choice nets.

{"text": "Title: Interpretable Concept Bottlenecks to Align Reinforcement Learning Agents\nAbstract: Goal misalignment, reward sparsity and difficult credit assignment are only a few of the many issues that make it difficult for deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn optimal policies. Unfortunately, the black-box nature of deep neural networks impedes the inclusion of domain experts for inspecting the model and revising suboptimal policies. To this end, we introduce *Successive Concept Bottleneck Agents* (SCoBots), that integrate consecutive concept bottleneck (CB) layers. In contrast to current CB models, SCoBots do not just represent concepts as properties of individual objects, but also as relations between objects which is crucial for many RL tasks. Our experimental results provide evidence of SCoBots' competitive performances, but also of their potential for domain experts to understand and regularize their behavior. Among other things, SCoBots enabled us to identify a previously unknown misalignment problem in the iconic video game, Pong, and resolve it. Overall, SCoBots thus result in more human-aligned RL agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/k4ntz/SCoBots .", "field": "cs", "label": 1}
{"text": "Title: Early Time Classification with Accumulated Accuracy Gap Control\nAbstract: Early time classification algorithms aim to label a stream of features without processing the full input stream, while maintaining accuracy comparable to that achieved by applying the classifier to the entire input. In this paper, we introduce a statistical framework that can be applied to any sequential classifier, formulating a calibrated stopping rule. This data-driven rule attains finite-sample, distribution-free control of the accuracy gap between full and early-time classification. We start by presenting a novel method that builds on the Learn-then-Test calibration framework to control this gap marginally, on average over i.i.d. instances. As this algorithm tends to yield an excessively high accuracy gap for early halt times, our main contribution is the proposal of a framework that controls a stronger notion of error, where the accuracy gap is controlled conditionally on the accumulated halt times. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, applicability, and usefulness of our method. We show that our proposed early stopping mechanism reduces up to 94% of timesteps used for classification while achieving rigorous accuracy gap control.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

The suggested approach involves a number of numerical issues which depend strongly on the coefficient of variation of the first passage time random variable. These issues are examined and solutions are proposed also involving the first passage time distribution function.

{"text": "Title: Mixed Static and Reconfigurable Metasurface Deployment in Indoor Dense Spaces: How Much Reconfigurability is Needed?\nAbstract: In this paper, we investigate how metasurfaces can be deployed to deliver high data rates in a millimeter-wave (mmWave) indoor dense space with many blocking objects. These surfaces can either be static metasurfaces (SMSs) that reflect with fixed phase-shifts or reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) that can reconfigure their phase-shifts to the currently served user. The latter comes with an increased power, cabling, and signaling cost. To see how reconfigurability affects the network performance, we propose an iterative algorithm based on the feasible point pursuit successive convex approximation method. We jointly optimize the types and phase-shifts of the surfaces and the time portion allocated to each user equipment to maximize the minimum data rate achieved by the network. Our numerical results demonstrate that the minimum data rate improves as more RISs are introduced but the gain diminishes after some point. Therefore, introducing more reconfigurability is not always necessary. Another result shows that to reach the same data rate achieved by using 22 SMSs, at least 18 RISs are needed. This suggests that when it is costly to deploy many RISs, as an inexpensive alternative solution, one can reach the same data rate just by densely deploying more SMSs.", "field": "cs", "label": 0}

{"text": "Title: A Joint Communication and Computation Framework for Digital Twin over Wireless Networks\nAbstract: In this paper, the problem of low-latency communication and computation resource allocation for digital twin (DT) over wireless networks is investigated. In the considered model, multiple physical devices in the physical network (PN) needs to frequently offload the computation task related data to the digital network twin (DNT), which is generated and controlled by the central server. Due to limited energy budget of the physical devices, both computation accuracy and wireless transmission power must be considered during the DT procedure. This joint communication and computation problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the overall transmission delay of the system under total PN energy and DNT model accuracy constraints. To solve this problem, an alternating algorithm with iteratively solving device scheduling, power control, and data offloading subproblems.

However, its practical realization is challenging: 1) processing intents, i.e., translate, decompose and identify the logic to fulfill the intent, and 2) intent conformance, that is, considering dynamic networks, the logic should be adequately adapted to assure intents. To address the latter, intent assurance is tasked with continuous verification and validation, including taking the necessary actions to align the operational and target states. In this paper, we define an assurance framework that allows us to detect and act when intent drift occurs. To do so, we leverage AI-driven policies, generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) which can quickly learn the necessary in-context requirements, and assist with the fulfillment and assurance of intents.", "field": "cs", "label": 1}

{"text": "Title: Machine learning for sports betting: should model selection be based on accuracy or calibration?\nAbstract: Sports betting's recent federal legalisation in the USA coincides with the golden age of machine learning. If bettors can leverage data to reliably predict the probability of an outcome, they can recognise when the bookmaker's odds are in their favour. As sports betting is a multi-billion dollar industry in the USA alone, identifying such opportunities could be extremely lucrative. Many researchers have applied machine learning to the sports outcome prediction problem, generally using accuracy to evaluate the performance of predictive models. We hypothesise that for the sports betting problem, model calibration is more important than accuracy. To test this hypothesis, we train models on NBA data over several seasons and run betting experiments on a single season, using published odds. We show that using calibration, rather than accuracy, as the basis for model selection leads to greater returns, on average (return on investment of $+34.69\\%$ versus $-35.17\\%$) and in the best case ($+36.93\\%$ versus $+5.56\\%$). These findings suggest that for sports betting (or any probabilistic decision-making problem), calibration is a more important metric than accuracy.

{"text": "Title: Parrot Captions Teach CLIP to Spot Text\nAbstract: Despite CLIP being the foundation model in numerous vision-language applications, the CLIP suffers from a severe text spotting bias. Such bias causes CLIP models to `Parrot' the visual text embedded within images while disregarding the authentic visual semantics. We uncover that in the most popular image-text dataset LAION-2B, the captions also densely parrot (spell) the text embedded in images. Our analysis shows that around 50% of images are embedded with visual text content, and around 30% of captions words are in these embedded visual content. Based on such observation, we thoroughly inspect the different released versions of CLIP models and verify that the visual text is the dominant factor in measuring the LAION-style image-text similarity for these models. To examine whether these parrot captions shape the text spotting bias, we train a series of CLIP models with LAION subsets curated by different parrot-caption-oriented criteria. We show that training with parrot captions easily shapes such bias but harms the expected visual-language representation learning in CLIP models.
